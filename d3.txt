What was easy about this assignment?

Translating the formulae in the textbook into code for the program was easy. 

What was challenging about this assignment?

One thing that was challenging was figuring out if the results we got were reasonable, or if our program had a bug. 
Also, at first, it was more intuitive to not split up the program into functions, so modularizing this program took some time.

What did you like about this assginment?

We liked that the assignment was broken up into tasks that made the requirements clear.

What did you dislike about this assignment?

We disliked the complexity of this project.

How did your team function?

At the beginning, we split up our work by setting up deadlines for certain tasks to be done. A lot of the work happened over 
multiple work sessions both in-person and over Zoom. 
In general, Robert and Michael worked a lot on the main function. PoeAn and Geethika did a lot of the documentation, 
including the README file. This was because PoeAn and Geethika were less familiar with Python. 

What did you learn from this assignment?

Geethika and PoeAn refamiliarized themselves with Python for this assignment. Additionally, we learned firsthand that 
some testing and learning samples, like samples from Dr. Suess, are not good for language modeling 
because they are very repetitive and will skew results.
