PM denies knowledge of AWB kickbacks
The Prime Minister has denied he knew AWB was paying kickbacks to Iraq despite writing to the wheat exporter asking to be kept fully informed on Iraq wheat sales.
Letters from John Howard and Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile to AWB have been released by the Cole inquiry into the oil for food program.
In one of the letters Mr Howard asks AWB managing director Andrew Lindberg to remain in close contact with the Government on Iraq wheat sales.
The Opposition's Gavan O'Connor says the letter was sent in 2002, the same time AWB was paying kickbacks to Iraq though a Jordanian trucking company.
He says the Government can longer wipe its hands of the illicit payments, which totalled $290 million.
"The responsibility for this must lay may squarely at the feet of Coalition ministers in trade, agriculture and the Prime Minister," he said.
But the Prime Minister says letters show he was inquiring about the future of wheat sales in Iraq and do not prove the Government knew of the payments.
"It would have been astonishing in 2002 if as Prime Minister I hadn't done anything I possibly could to preserve Australia's very valuable wheat market," he said.

Email questions
Today at the inquiry, AWB trading manager Peter Geary has been questioned about an email he received in May 2000.
It indicated that the Iraqi Grains Board had approached AWB to provide "after-sales service".
Mr Geary said he had forwarded the email to two AWB colleagues and did not remember reading it, although he said he may have skimmed it.

Support
AWB still has plenty of support among grain growers in central western New South Wales despite the revelations of the Cole inquiry.
Producers say they broadly support AWB's attempts to get the best prices for their products.
"I think it's all a ploy by overseas interests to try and get the single desk put aside. The stories that are going round about the commission and everything, I think that's the way people have got to do things to do business with the Middle East and Asian countries," one producer said.
"I think it's actually a pretty reasonable system and I think actually I'd give them pretty fair support at the moment. I think on average they've performed fairly well," another producer said.
"The biggest thing about someone else taking over is whether the multinationals will get too much of a foothold in there and take it too much to their advantage."

Grain prices
But an analyst predicts grain prices will drop another $20 a tonne on the back of the inquiry into AWB.
Malcolm Bartholomaeus says pool returns have already dropped by $20 a tonne this year from the average price over the past five years.
He says the premiums that AWB was achieving through its wheat export monopoly have been severely eroded.

SA farmers help fire ravaged neighbours
Farmers in South Australia's south-east are donating truckloads of hay to their neighbours across the border in the wake of the Grampians bushfires.
In just a few days, farmers have donated 250 tonnes of hay, as well as agistment for cattle.
They say that is just the beginning.
Fodder drive coordinator Peter O'Conner says he has been overwhelmed by the response.
"All the hay that's going this week has all gone from places that have donated one load or up to two loads of hay," he said.
"We've got one man that's donated two full loads and the rest are all one loads, straight loads that we're moving this week.

Floodwaters close highway
A major highway between the Northern Territory and Western Australia remains blocked by floodwaters today.
The Victoria River has cut the Victoria Highway and also flooded the remote Pigeon Hole Aboriginal community.
Stockman Simon Ham describes the relocation of a hundred people to higher ground.
"They had all their vehicles moved out of the community and they had a few camps set up and they were moving more people and belongings out with a couple of boats, just onto higher ground, only 500 metres from the community," he said.
"They are up on a sandstone ridge at the moment and I think the river heights might be up for a little longer but I think it [the Victoria River] will start going down."

Grain company sold for $9m
Tasmania's main grain company has changed hands for the second time in just three years.
The former state-owned Tasmanian Grain Elevators Board has been sold to local agribusiness Roberts Limited for about $9 million.
The deal includes silos at Launceston, Devonport and Powranna in northern Tasmania.
John Macleod from Roberts Limited says the company bid when the board was first privatised.
"We were very disappointed we weren't successful at that point of time," he said.

Wine workers stop work
Workers at Hardy Wines' Stanley winery in south-western New South Wales have walked off the job for the second time in a week.
Forty staff walked out this morning in a dispute over a new enterprise bargaining agreement.
The stopwork comes just as the region's wine grape crush gets under way.
Hardy Wines took the matter to the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) on Friday.

Wool body eyes sportswear industry
The $50 billion global sportswear industry is the new target of wool promotion body, Australian Wool Innovation (AWI).
AWI is showing wool blend t-shirts and casual wear to manufacturers this week at the largest trade show for the industry being held in Germany.
AWI's Len Stephens says although wool-blend sportswear will be at the pricier end of the market, shoppers are willing to pay more.
"The sports apparel market sector is one of the biggest and certainly the fastest growing apparel sector in the world, and it's no secret that wool hasn't had a very big share of that market at all," he said.
"The level of wool, particularly Australian merino wool in the sports market is really almost below the radar.

Organisation to step up banning rodeos campaign
Tasmania's rodeo industry is under sustained attack from animal rights activists after another animal had to be destroyed at a weekend event.
A bucking horse was put down after breaking a leg at Ulverstone on Saturday.
Two weeks ago, a bull was destroyed after apparently breaking its back during a bull-riding competition at Carrick.
The owner of both animals, Brian Fish, says they were unfortunate accidents and not an animal welfare issue.
But Emma Haswell from Against Animal Cruelty Tasmania says her organisation will up its efforts to have rodeos banned.

Snails used in cancer research
New research is under way to investigate whether South Australian sea snails could eventually be used to treat cancer.
Until now the state's snail population has been virtually unexplored but Flinders University hopes to discover beneficial compounds in predatory sea snails, known as whelks.
Marine biologist Dr Kirsten Benkendorff says the work follows research overseas, where clinical trials are now investigating anti-cancer properties.
"The whelks that I'm looking at at the moment are not currently harvested and not really considered a useful resource so I think that there's a lot of potential economic benefits from that side of things," she said.

Processors fail to meet kangaroo meat demand
International demand for kangaroo meat is putting pressure on Australian processors.
Despite high prices, harvesting quotas are not being met leaving a big gap in the market.
Phil Franolick from King River International Processors in Perth says Europeans are attracted to the meat's low fat content and Russians are consuming large amounts of kangaroo sausages and mince.
"As far as I know every skerrick of manufactured meat that is produced by human consumption processors virtually goes to the Russian market now," he said.

People warned to be on snake alert
With temperatures soaring this summer, particularly in southern Australia, snakes are on the move.
People are being warned to keep their eyes open out in the paddock, especially in areas hit by bushfires, with snakes forced from their usual habitat.
Maria Dovey from Reptile Rescue Tasmania has these words of advice.
"Any people who are regularly outdoors, whether they be camping, bush walking, people who're on the land working, they must always carry at least two bandages with them and a mobile phone," she said.

Aerial spraying begins to control locust threat
Victoria's high country farmers have begun aerial spraying to try to control the threat of locusts.
It is the first time locust plagues have made it to the region, with continued rain and warm weather assisting breeding conditions.
Pastures and crops have already been wiped out by the pest.

Injury won't stop baton runner
A southern Queensland cattle farmer says a knee injury will not stop him running in the Queen's baton relay today in the lead-up to the Commonwealth Games.
Stanthorpe's Bill Bonner travelled to Coffs Harbour in New South Wales to run his leg of the relay.
And he says injury will not prevent him from making the 500 metre dash.
"About two weeks ago I was jumping off my motorbike and twisted a ligament in my knee and I haven't been able to do more than walk since," he said.
"But I promise you I will run that baton because you get such an adrenalin rush that I think you could only have one leg and you could still run it."

The NZ apple debate continues
In a New Zealand newspaper on the weekend, members of the New Zealand apple industry voiced concern regarding the legitimacy of the "science" used in the draft Import Risk Analysis put out last month by Biosecurity Australia. The draft Import Risk Analysis (IRA) determines the risk of fireblight and other pests and diseases if New Zealand apples are imported into Australia.
Under the World Trade Organisation's rules Australia can refuse the importation of New Zealand apples if they are able to provide scientific evidence of a substantial disease or pest risk. But according to the New Zealand apple growers, "professional" scientific evidence shows that mature apples imported into Australia pose no risk of fireblight. However the spokesperson for the New Zealand based Australian Apple Access Group Phil Allison says Biosecurity Australia has not provided the mathematical model used to determine the "scientific" evidence stated in the draft IRA.
A spokesperson for Biosecurity Australia said: "the formulas used in the risk assessment are provided in the Draft Import Risk Analysis Report on New Zealand Apples, which was published last December for anyone to read. A competent modeller can reproduce the model used in the risk analysis from the formulas given in the report." The chairman of the fireblight task force, John Corboy, says the response and concern from New Zealand apple growers regarding the draft IRA is not surprising, but Australia has to be able to exercise its right to refuse the apples based on the scientific evidence it has presented in the IRA.

Younger trees producing more pears
A trial plot of young williams pear trees has produced fruit three years after they were planted. Usually the trees don't produce fruit until they're about five or six years old. The trees are part of a five year experimental project, funded by SPC Ardmona through the Canned Fruits Association, Horticulture Australia Limited and the Lenne family orchard - where the trial plot is located.
Horticulture consultant Bas Van Den Ende says the aim of the project is to increase the number of williams pears grown in the future by encouraging the younger trees to produce earlier than usual.

Local federal National MP supports AWB single desk
The federal Member for Parkes, John Cobb, has brought into the debate over the future of AWB. This comes as the Cole inquiry continues to examines AWB's role in the Iraq oil-for-food program. On top of this the National party will today try and reinvent itself. Mr Cobb says he supports the single desk and producers must become far more pro-active. On the issue of the National party's future, he says they will make themselves different from the Liberals. Mr Cobb says they do represent regional areas far better then his Liberal colleagues.

Fish deaths believed to be due to lack of oxygen
The Department of Primary Industries is investigating a big fish kill in the Lachlan River upstream of the Lake Cargelligo Weir. Between 150 and 200 native fish died in the incident earlier this month. District Fisheries Officer Phillip McCarthy says murray cod, bream and golden and silver perch were killed but no introduced species died. He says inquiries suggest the deaths were the result of an increased water flow not chemical poisoning.

Vegetable industry concern on labels
Agriculture group AUSVEG says food labelling laws in Australia are a joke because nobody follows them and enforcement of the rules is non-existent. AUSVEG says consumers are still being fooled into thinking they're buying Australian products because of false or poor labelling.

Red tape slows west Kimberley horticulture
The Kimberley could be WA's food bowl with its top soil, available water and sunshine all year round - though its facing hurdles to expand. Sweet potato grower Paul Higgins still relies on a generator and says Broome horticulturalists are the only ones in the state not connected to the grid. He and his neighbours have been applying to get a nine kilometre extension to the current grid system to bring them into line. A spokesperson from Western Power says it is possible, though it's up to customers to pay for their connection costs, regardless of the distance from the existing grid. Land acquisition is also causing headaches. Mr Higgins purchased adjoining country last June, though still hasn't received title. He can't improve the land until this is cleared. "All the issues have been resolved - area surveyed, native title issues have been put to bed, monies have been paid, but still we don't have land title. We can't clear the land, apply for water title, can't do anything," he said. The Minister for Planning and Infrastructure, Alannah McTiernan, says the seven month delay is regrettable and Mr Higgins should have been made aware of the hold up in the West Australian Planning Office because the land was not correctly zoned. Though Ms McTiernan says the delay may have worked in his favour, given the land was sold at 2004 property prices. Mr Higgins still waits for the official all clear before he can start ploughing the Pindan for more potatoes.

Richmond River to stay open to fishers
The Department of Primary Industries has decided against closing the Richmond River to commercial and recreational fishers in the wake of last week's fish kill. About 300 dead fish and eels were discovered near Wardell last Thursday, when oxygen levels in the water dropped alarmingly. The acting director of fisheries management, Anthony Hirst, says inspectors will take further samples from the river tomorrow.

Rural woman finalist
The next 10 days may seem like an eternity for one at least one Rosebank farmer. Catherine Ford is one of three finalists in the quest to find the New South Wales Rural Woman of the Year.
The macadamia producer hopes a win in the event will help her to produce a guide promoting sustainability in the industry, but she admits she's amazed to have even made it this far.

DSE 'is carrying out proactive Grampians burning off'
On the rural report yesterday we heard farmers and CFA officers say they feel the intensity of the Grampians fires could have been lessened if more fuel reduction burns had been carried out in the national park. Charley DeFegley, who's the Ararat VFF branch secretary and a CFA divisional commander, said he felt not enough burning off had been carried out and this had contributed to the destructive force of the fire. But the Department of Sustainability's fire manager for the Horsham district and incident controller for the Grampians fires, Geoff Evans, says the agency has a proactive burning off policy. He says burning off is hampered because some landowners are not keen about burning off beside their properties and the weather does not allow controlled burns at some times of the year, giving a very small window of opportunity. He says there is also strong division within the community about whether more or less burning off should be carried out in the national park. But Mr Evans says about 5,000 to 8,000 hectares of the park are burnt off every year.

Farmers and ag agencies get speedy aid to farmers
The state government has announced it will commit millions of dollars to the recovery effort for the new year bushfires including the blaze in the Grampians and a ministerial task force is to start assessing need. The government says it will also help landowners facing hardship as a result of their water supplies being used by firefighting. But already, Department of Primary Industry officers, the Victorian Farmers Federation, haulage contractors and farmers all over western Victoria, have been working at a grassroots level to help fire affected landowners. Hundreds of tonnes of hay, 21 semi-loads of which was brought to a collection point at Moyston from Warrnambool yesterday, has been donated to farmers who need fodder for their surviving animals. Bruce McKay says he has been on farms helping to put sheep down and fixing fencing in the Willaura area. Tim Wrench from the Warrnambool Coop says people came from all around the area to donate hay. Haulier Scott Wilson from Koroit said when he went onto farms to collect hay people said "just load up until you're full". Neil James from the DPI says hay is being donated from New South Wales and South Australia. Charlie DeFegeley from the VFF says the response has been amazing.

Fuel price, weather blamed for hike in fresh food costs
Fuel prices and fluctuating weather conditions are being blamed for a 12 per cent jump in the cost of fresh food over the past year.
The latest food industry analysis from Rabobank shows consumers are paying more for their milk, meat, fruit and vegetables.
But Rabobank's Dr Ben Russell says the money is going to manufacturers and processors, not growers.
"In the case of passing on higher fuel prices it's to the contrary because farmers have got to pay higher fuel prices as well as see the retail prices of the products they're producing going up," he said.

Low prices, falling demand slow down wheat exports
Wheat exports have slowed due to low prices and falling demand from Australia's traditional markets.
Despite some sales to Egypt, other markets including Iraq, Pakistan, China and India have failed to deliver the expected number of contracts.
With the second largest global crop on record, competition for tenders is particularly fierce.
Grains trader Lloyd George says there are a range of factors for the slow-down.
"Certainly Iraq has been an important customer of Australia's over a period of time, put in pretty significant tonnages and over the recent months AWB hasn't been exporting the quantities we have in the past," he said.
"But there's a whole bunch of broader issues out there as well. A lot of the markets whereby Australia would hope to sell the quantity of the harvest into are the same markets that are quiet this year."

Iraq market
AWB's national pool manager David Johnson denies the oil-for-food inquiry is having an impact on trade and says Australia has not lost Iraq as a major market.
He says AWB submitted a tender to supply a million tonnes of wheat to Iraq last week.
"We'll be looking to participate in that tender, absolutely," he said.
"Probably relatively, compared to the structure of the market in previous years, this pool return might look a little different but the world market is different.
"I think it's just a fact that the export business is extremely quiet and I think you'd find the same comments from other exporting countries around the world."
AWB has announced an increase to new season pool estimates, lifting the returns for hard wheat by $2.00 a tonne and for noodle grades by $4.00 a tonne.
There is a mixed outlook for other grains.
Record soy bean harvests in the US, Ukraine and Brazil mean there is a large global supply of the canola alternative, which will put pressure on oil seed prices in Australia.
David Syme from the WA Grain Pool says malting barley sales have been slow due to the Chinese New Year but sales should soon pick up.
"At this point in time, Australia really has been holding the major stocks of malting barley around the world," he said.
"The Canadians don't have a lot to offer to the marketplace, that puts us in a good position and of course the next lot of supplies of malting barley really come out of Europe in August, so some time away yet.
"Once the Chinese re-emerge we look forward to a strong selling program." 

Inquiry chief
Meanwhile the head of the oil-for-food inquiry has yet to respond to complaints that the investigation is not being conducted fairly.
Counsel for AWB told the hearing yesterday that witnesses had been ambushed and ridiculed.
The comments were in response to criticism from Commissioner Terence Cole last week that AWB's level of cooperation was a facade.
AWB's lawyer said Commissioner Cole's expectations were unreasonable because of the time available to prepare witness statements and the availability of documents.
In another development, the New South Wales Farmers Association says it is prepared to fight to maintain the single desk for wheat exports.
Despite keeping a low profile since the start of the inquiry, the association has today come out in support of the current monopoly export system.
Grains committee chairman Angus McLaren says growing pressure from opponents of the single desk is concerning but grain growers are prepared for any challenge to their marketing system.
"I think the most important thing we can do and what we've been concentrating on doing is gathering our thoughts and doing research and preparing for the battle that we think probably will occur," he said.

Lib MP pushes for NZ apple ban
A federal Liberal Party MP is pushing for a permanent ban on apple imports from New Zealand.
Russell Broadbent from the seat of McMillan, east of Melbourne, is drafting a private member's bill to ban imports from any country with the disease fireblight.
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has rejected the bill, saying it would also affect a wide range of imports and exports.
But Mr Broadbent says he will push on with the plan.
"Mr McGauran is the Minister but he doesn't actually have many orchards in his seat of Gippsland does he?" Mr Broadbent said.
"So I don't suppose he's exposed as closely to the issue and as passionately to the issue as many of the backbench members are across the nation."

Avocado growers to compete with NZ imports
With harvest about to begin, avocado growers are facing stiff competition from New Zealand imports.
For the past five years, the imports have petered out before the start of the local harvest but this year a record New Zealand crop has led to a 50 per cent jump in exports to Australia.
North Queensland's Shepard avocados will be the first to be picked here.
Shepard Australia chairman Jim Kochi says growers need to focus on sending quality fruit to the markets.
"They certainly don't have enough people left in New Zealand to consume their crop, I think they're all here in Australia ... most of them and so the rest of it is coming to Australia and it is a large volume of fruit," he said.

Govt urged to get tougher on enforcing food labelling laws
Fruit and vegetable growers are calling on the Federal Government to get tougher on states which do not enforce country-of-origin labelling laws.
Producer group AUSVEG says some states are not pushing for new laws to be implemented on fresh and packaged produce, and that is misleading consumers.
Chief executive John Roach says the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC) needs to look at the issue again.
"Excuse the pun out of the vegetable industry but you do need a reasonable amount of carrot and you do need a little bit of stick," he said.
"And what has not happened with any consistency across Australia is that last one, that bit of stick, it is not consistent - it varies hugely and often there are cases where it doesn't exist at all."
The ACCC says the labelling issue has been looked at and the authority is satisfied with current compliance.

Growers to get less for currant crop
Dried fruit growers supplying Australia's largest processor have been dealt a major blow.
Uncontracted currant growers have learnt that they will receive just $650 per tonne for their fruit this year, half of what they were paid last year.

Code of conduct for rodeo organisers
Rodeo organisers in Tasmania will have to comply with a mandatory code of conduct in the future.
The code is being implemented after a public outcry over rodeo practices.
There have been two very public incidents at rodeos in the past fortnight that have outraged animal rights activists and the television watching public.
A bull was put down after dragging its paralysed hindquarters behind it as it left the ring and on Saturday a bucking horse was put down in the arena after it broke a leg as it exited the chute.
The public outcry has forced the State Government to declare a mandatory set of regulations will soon be enforced on all rodeos before a permit is issued.
A major requirement will be for a vet to be on site at all events, rather than only on call.

Camp cooks in demand
Camp cooks and grader drivers are proving the hardest jobs to fill on cattle stations in northern Australia this year.
The lure of high-paying mining jobs has kept many away from the Kimberley, in particular.
While they have been lucky to get a full team at Flora Valley Station near Halls Creek, manager Wayne Bean says camp cooks are a dying breed.
"One time, once people finished working as stockhands or ringers on stations they found their little niche in life, either cooking for the station, or driving the grader or running as a bore runner but that just doesn't seem to be happening now," he said.
"People are drifting off into the mines and other big corporations and there's still a few that seem who enjoy being on the stations, and it's not about money for them.

Flooding causes detour
Floodwaters in the Northern Territory are still blocking a major highway today.
The Victoria Highway between Katherine and Kununurra is cut by swollen rivers in at least three places.

NZ shearers break work record
A team of New Zealand shearers has broken the world three-stand lamb shearing record
Jimmy Clarke and Peter and Shane Harvey shore 2,350 lambs in nine hours at Mt Linton Station on the South Island yesterday, breaking the record by 400 head.
Peter Harvey says he has always wanted to shear 700 head a day and has now achieved that goal but did not realise how hard it would be.

Live exports to Egypt halted
The Federal Government has halted live cattle exports to Egypt in the wake of mistreatment claims.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says $350,000 was spent on improving the treatment of cattle at the Bassatin Abattoir in Egypt after cruelty concerns were first raised in 2003.
But Channel Nine's 60 Minutes program last night showed footage of cattle having their tendons cut, which the program says was filmed last month.
Mr McGauran says his decision to halt the trade while the claims are investigated, is not an extreme reaction.
"We shouldn't be defensive about this," he said.
"Where allegations are made, no matter how ill-founded or how lacking in evidence we must confront it head-on if we are to retain the confidence of the general public and fulfil our responsibilities to farmers."
Meat and Livestock Australia says the ban sets a bad precedent.
General manager of live exports, Mike Hayward says he is certain the cattle showed in the 60 Minutes footage were not from Australia.
And he denies suggestions little has changed since the cruelty claims were first raised three years ago.

Iraq will still buy Aust wheat, Vaile says
Trade Minister Mark Vaile has confirmed Iraq will continue to buy Australian wheat but not from current exporter AWB, which is facing claims it paid kickbacks to Saddam Hussein.
But according to grains analysts Australian growers could stay shut out of Iraq until August.
While some grain exporters have already lodged applications to export to Iraq, grains analyst Lloyd George says the next Iraq wheat tender may not by for another four months.
"Not having access to Iraq for maybe 60 per cent of the year would be significant," he said.
But following his mission to Baghdad, Mr Vaile says Iraq could be ready to take as much as 350,000 tons of wheat a month, but cannot confirm any deal or when it may start.
"There will be further tenders coming up in the short term, we need to look at what mechanisms need to be deployed in the meantime to get our wheat growers access to that," he said.
Meanwhile representatives from grain companies ABB Grain, CBH and Graincorp are meeting with federal politicians today.
Western Australian Liberal Wilson Tuckey has organised the meeting to allow MPs to meet alternative grain traders and learn more about the grains industry.
ABB's managing director Michael Iwaniw says while his company is not advocating change to the wheat single desk, it is ready to take advantage of it.
"If, and I stress if, the legislation were to change and if there were opportunities, and if perhaps we could assist in the marketing of wheat for the benefit of Australian growers then we will certainly look at it," he said.
A lecturer in business strategy at Melbourne Business School says grain growers would be better off without a single desk.
Professor Paul Kerin says the oil-for-food inquiry justifies the need to introduce free competition, and let alternative exporters to enter the market.
Professor Kerin says the ability to spread risk is the key for growers.
"Under free competition, growers have a choice and if one of those traders messes up, then it's not so much of a problem for growers because they can change to another trader," he said.
"In fact, growers should have the right to punish a trader if they really mess up, and so growers will be better off.

Wool market expected to continue gaining ground
The wool industry is closely watching how China reacts to climbing wool prices with the season's biggest sales this week.
More than 82,000 bales are on offer in the wake of strong global interest which has pushed prices to a season high of 746 cents a kilo clean.
But Maurie McNeill from Elders Wool says despite some concern among buyers, the market should continue to gain ground.
"We've got the largest offering of the season coming up this week, so obviously yes we are cautious and we're seeing quite a bit of Chinese resistance at these levels," he said.

Harvey Beef handover delayed
The handover of Western Australia's largest beef processor and exporter Harvey Beef has been delayed while the new owners try to strike a deal with workers.
The Stark-Harmony consortium was due to takeover today but has asked for a one-week delay to allow workers to vote on a new enterprise bargaining agreement.
Feedlotter Paul O'Meehan who helped broker the Stark Harmony deal, says he hopes they can sign off on the deal by next Monday.
"The new owners are better off getting these problems sorted and starting with a fresh slate rather than going into business and not being organised," he said.

Campaigners worried about approval of 'terminator technology'
Gene ethics campaigners are concerned a technology which stops seeds breeding naturally will be approved for commercial cropping in Australia.
Members of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, including Australia, banned "terminator technology" in 2000, when global protests forced biotech company Monsanto to state it would not commercialise the process.
But Bob Phelps from the Gene Ethics Network says the Federal Government is now reconsidering its stance which would threaten the natural biodiversity of seed crops.
"At a recent meeting in Granada in Spain, the Australian Government was arguing that the current ban should be modified," he said.
"The officials are saying that there is no ban on terminator in Australia at the moment and that any application that was made to the Australian regulators would be examined on a case by case basis."
But Dr Jim Peacock from the CSIRO's Plant Industries does not see the technology as a threat.

Research to investigate fish movements
Marine scientists say it is too early to tell whether climate change is responsible for a new mix of marine species being found in Tasmanian waters.
Increasing numbers of southern Australian fish are being discovered off Tasmania's coastline.
Two silver drummers were recently caught for the first time off the wharf at Stanley in the state's north-west.
CSIRO scientist Dr Peter Last says research is being carried out into whether climate change and warmer water is the cause.
"It turns out that something like 10 per cent of the species that we have in the coastal areas of Tasmania have moved further south," he said.

WA braces for third cyclone
The north-west of Western Australia is bracing itself for a third cyclone in as many months, as a tropical low develops off the Pilbara coast.
The Bureau of Meteorology expects the low to intensify rapidly and develop into a cyclone later today.

Aquatic weed to be tested overseas
An invasive aquatic weed is proving extremely hard to eradicate from the Northern Territory.
Cabomba has been discovered in the remote coastal community of Gove.
Further west, the Darwin River has been found to be the only place in the nation where the weed is producing viable seed.
Regional weed officer Steve Wingrave says that explains the rapid spread of the weed along 11 kilometres of the river.
"It's an ornamental plant, the same as roses or any plant you have in your garden," he said.
"Lots of them are hybrid varieties so they are not going to produce viable seeds.
"It turns out that we have got a variety which is producing viable seed. But it mightn't be a result of the variety we have got.

Farmers look to overhaul image
A campaign to overhaul the image of Australian farmers kicks off in Queensland today.
The "Every Family needs a Farmer" promotion is being run by Agforce and features the Coe family, from Durong, in the state's south.
Cattle and grain producer Karen Coe hopes it will change city people's perceptions of agriculture.
"Just even on small terms we have friends come out and say goodness you've got lots of trees and they don't fully understand that the way we farm these days is very different to driving a tractor around the paddock and ploughing, ploughing and ploughing," she said.

New marine species found in reef survey
Several new species of fish, plants and at least one new species of crab have been discovered in a big new survey of the Great Barrier Reef.
Dr Roland Pitcher from the CSIRO says scientists spent more than 300 days at sea covering 536,000 square kilometres of the reef from Cape York to Fraser Island.
"We've seen a number of new fish, possibly a new pipehorse and maybe a new species of crab at least," he said.
"And we can also confirm that there's been a number of species that have been confirmed in Australia waters for the first time.

ABARE Outlook 2006 conference
Today's National Rural News was broadcast live from the ABARE Outlook conference in Canberra.
Matt O'Sullivan: "The Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics is taking its best shot at predicting what's going to happen in the farming and mining sectors over the next 12 months. It's fairly good news so far, depending on how you look at it, because it appears there won't be too many nasty surprises for the nation's farmers this year. James Martin has been talking to ABARE to get the latest, what's the story James?"
James Martin: "Matt, I don't usually like using the word normal when it comes to forecasting, but this is as normal an outlook as what I can remember. It's a story of continuing to build after drought, but with that predictable warning that without greater improvement in world trade conditions, the terms of trade for farmers are really going to squeeze. ABARE tells us though that perhaps more of the same is not necessarily a bad thing. His morning, for instance, it's telling us that the grain harvest for 05-06 is the second highest on record. We've also seen, of course, good movement of beef into Japan, and we're even seeing some rebound in the wool price as well."
Matt O'Sullivan: "So it seems that there is going to be higher production in many areas in the time ahead. Is that going to translate to more money in farmers' pockets?"
James Martin: "Not necessarily. Overall we're seeing export earnings at a record $134b, that's including minerals and energy. Now in the farm sector alone, those export earnings are tipped at $29.6b in 06-07, so that's up 6 per cent on last year. But the warning is commodity prices are going to decline across many areas, so while we have increased production pushing up export earnings from wheat, rice, barley, sugar, wine, lamb, live exports and dairy, we also have prices for many items falling. Overall, ABARE says commodity prices in the ag sector will fall by about 1.7 per cent, following a rise in 05-06 of about 1.4 per cent. So the bottom line I suppose, the net value of farm production, will actually fall to around $6b in 06-07. That's down 6 per cent."
Matt O'Sullivan: "What about the economic picture being painted by ABARE's chief, Brian Fisher?"
James Martin: "Economic growth should continue at about 4 per cent, which it has been doing over the last 12 months or so. There has been talk of that "super-commodities cycle" which is helping growth in the minerals and energy sector actually cascading into agriculture. The message from Dr Fisher though is that won't happen:"
"There have been people talking about the notion that we've got a super commodities cycle that a whole lot of the action that we've seen in minerals and energy will then cascade into agriculture. I think frankly that's a bit simplistic. A lot of the story in the case of agriculture is on the supply side. We are as I said before seeing a good strong demand, but in the case of agriculture, it's both a demand and supply story".
"Brian Fisher also says that farm costs, things like fertiliser and fuel, will actually increase by about one per cent. Now on oil, the benchmark for oil prices, that's West Texas Intermediate Crude, that'll stay high in the near term, but over the medium term, down from the current 65 dollars a barrel down below $40 a barrel by 2010. On the dollar, a moderate depreciation, around US73c for 06-07, continuing down though by 2010-11. That's a long way ahead, but Brian Fisher's saying perhaps around US65c for the Australian dollar."
Alan Oster (National Australia Bank): "We think the Aussie dollar is probably going to get down to the levels that ABARE's talking about, except that we think it's going to come down a lot quicker. So we expect something like 68c by this time next year."
Matt O'Sullivan: "And that's going to have a big impact on exports?"
James Martin: "It clearly helps in some senses, in the sense that it means you're more competitive, but if you're on the import side, the oil price goes down in US dollars, but it really doesn't go down at all."
Matt O'Sullivan: "Now I don't think you've got very good news about rural commodity prices?"
James Martin: "Again part of this is that we have a faster fall in the currency, is that in our view, when we look at US dollar agricultural prices, we're down around ten per cent. Now part of that is beef, which has come off really high levels, and we think sugar eventually will start to slow down as well. So we're expecting prices to come back, and the volumes broadly to offset that, so you get those different effects coming through.
Matt O'Sullivan: "So that might be a faster impact than what ABARE's predicting?"
James Martin: "Yes."
Matt O'Sullivan: "You've also been talking about continuing concerns about the labour shortage, particularly skilled labour?"
James Martin: "Yes, when we run our business surveys we find it is very difficult, in fact, even in December this year, it's more difficult according to business to get suitable labour than any time, including the late 80s."
Matt O'Sullivan: "So the concern is always, will that show up in wages?"
James Martin: "At this stage, the good news is nothing's happened. That's why the Reserve Bank is still talking about if we're going to move rates it's more likely up than down. At the end of the day, our view on rates will be, they won't do anything, but the wages one is critical, and if they see any signs of wage pressures starting to move up, then they will pull the trigger."
Matt O'Sullivan: "Will the importation of labour be likely to hold off wage increases?"
James Martin: "To the extent that you can take some pressure off by increasing the level of immigration, that clearly does help. And in the rural sector we know about difficulties of getting people in to help with crops, so it helps there. But at the end of the day, I think yes, there's an element of that, but I think also the domestic part of the economy is really starting to slow a bit as well, so I think unemployment's going to go from 5.2, 5.3 up to about 5.7, 5.8, and that will help. So I think the fact is that within the economy as such, you're probably not going to have to do anything."
Matthew O'Sullivan: "Around Australia, you're listening to a special broadcast of National Rural News from the ABARE Outlook Conference in Canberra.
"Well, the Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran told the conference this morning that the NFF and the government aren't in total agreement about imported workers being a solution to the labour shortage, but certainly agreed there is a problem.
"John Roach joins us now, he's the chief executive of vegetable grower group Ausveg, John is this a critical issue for the horticulture industry?"
John Roach: "I think not only critical to the horticulture industry, it's critical to rural Australia, and I'd probably go so far as to say that rural Australia's undergoing significant change in its labour content that it will require, particularly in the next five to 10 years."
Matthew O'Sullivan: "What about these guest worker schemes? Are they having an impact in your sector?"
John Roach: "If I look at other countries, yes it does. If I look at New Zealand, part of the horticulture industry in New Zealand does use what I call cheaper labour. What they're doing there is bringing it it in, upskilling it there, and sending it back to those countries as part of their aid projects, for example. We in Australia don't have that opportunity at the moment, but if I look at the farm unit in itself, as vegetable growers, much of the innovation happens on small to medium farm businesses. It's not the big end of town in vegetable production. So that area is where the innovation happens. You'd require less labour in that, but you'd need more specialised labour.
Matthew O'Sullivan: "Is there a need to protect smaller farmers in the future?"
John Roach: "It's more about going to informed choice. The vegetable industry in particular will segment itself into three areas. One is larger production, larger farms, working on lowering costs. The middle section is about innovation, smaller farm units being out there on the cutting edge. The last third of the industry produces about five per cent of production. I think providing informed choice for that sector, of what they actually do with their lives and their farms and their assets, I think it's really important for Australia on social content to be able to allow those people to make informed choice about whether they wish to grow, or not grow and depart."
Matthew O'Sullivan: "We've also heard a lot over the past few years about the significant of China to the global economy, and Australian agriculture. Reporter Sally Davison has been looking at the impact of China on the world economy. Sal, this week is critical in terms of China's future in the global market?"
Sally Davison: "That's right, the National People's Congress is releasing its five year plan, a blueprint for national policy makers. This will affect everything from urbanisation, migration into major cities, to unemployment. But Yiping Hup from Asia CitiGroup says the energy sector will be most affect by these changes. The Chinese Government has said it wants to increase energy efficiency by 20 per cent in the next 20 years, by focussing on environmentally friendly industries. So the international energy sector is eagerly awaiting the release of the Chinese Government's five-year plan."

Fresh roadkill sought for WA snake study
Roadkill is set to help scientists unlock the largely mysterious world of snakes in the far north of Western Australia.
Travellers are being asked to keep their eyes out for specimens that can be studied.
David Pearson from the Department of Conservation and Land Management says venomous and whip snakes from the Kimberley are of particular interest.
"The thing is they're only useful when they are really fresh," he said.
"For instance if a snake is hit during the night, you get it first thing in the morning or that very night, by the time the sun gets to them and birds of prey and other things like that, they are smelly and a bit putrid - no one wants to see them in their freezer and they certainly don't make good museum specimens!
"If they've been run over a couple of times by a road train, they're not very useful!"

Swan Hill ethanol distillery work to begin
Work will start next month on a $60 million ethanol distillery at Swan Hill, in Victoria's north-west.
Australian Ethanol has raised 12.5 million for the project, which should be on line by the end of the year.
Chief executive Peter Anderton expects the facility to process 300,000 tonnes of barley, corn, wheat and sorghum a year.

Cattle producers lean towards smaller exports
Cattle producers in the Northern Territory are leading a push towards smaller live export vessels, despite a growing number of large ships entering the trade.
Italian firm, Siba Ships, has enlarged its fleet with three new vessels, due to enter the trade by the end of next year.
Steve Ellison from the Northern Territory Livestock Exporters Association says he has been surprised to see a determined swing away from large ships, with their lower freight rates.
"We are getting a bit of a backlash from producers who would prefer to see (their cattle) go on the smaller ships," he said.
"I think that a lot of the producers realise that they think those big ships aren't quite all beer and skittles.
"In fact, I bought some cattle a few weeks ago and one of the provisos was that I had to give a guarantee that they wouldn't go on a big ship.

Bird flu diagnosis training stepped up
The CSIRO is training Department of Agriculture staff in every state and territory to improve the nation's ability to diagnose a bird flu outbreak.
An avian virologist at the agency's laboratory in Victoria, Paul Selleck, says because many Asian poultry flocks are vaccinated, symptoms are masked, making the virus difficult to detect.
In Australia though, the disease should be easier to detect, because birds aren't vaccinated.
"In chickens we see swollen heads, excessive expulsion of liquid through the mouth," he said.
"They also become depressed, and you start to see haemorrhages on the unfeathered parts of the skin such as the feet.

Promising findings in fight against pests
Australian vineyards could one day be free of pesticides.
Research in South Australia has found predatory insects including wasps could instead be used to eradicate pests like the brown apple moth.
University of Adelaide PhD student Cate Paull has spent four years studying pests and insects in the Coonawarra, and says the results are promising.

Vic growers to let grapes rot
For the first time, grapes will be left to rot this harvest in one of Victoria's premium grape growing areas.
Poor prices and a lack of contracts are being blamed for the plight of growers in the King Valley, in the state's north-east.
Producing 30 per cent of the state's top, higher priced varieties, Wendy Batey from King Valley Vignerons, says growers are too scared to talk publicly.
"Well growers are really reluctant to speak out because they're in such an incredibly vulnerable position financially," she said.
"They've been selling, many of them have been selling grapes for four years below cost and they're basically quite frightened of jeopardising their fruit sales this year.

Controversial Qld water charges suspended
The Queensland Government has suspended controversial new water charges, which irrigators had been refusing to pay.
Premier Peter Beattie will defer the introduction of the $4 a megalitre charge, and $100 annual bore licence fee, until a review is conducted.
The funds were to be used to manage the state's water resources, but Paul Schembri from Canegrowers says irrigators were angry at a lack of transparency.
"In the short run we were very outraged by the introduction of this new tax, make no mistake," he said.
"It was a brand new tax.
""I guess the issue is, how transparent is the process? how independent is it?

Ministers urged to reject trucking fees hike
Farmers are calling on state and federal transport ministers to reject a proposal to increase trucking charges, ahead of a vote on the new fees tomorrow.
The National Transport Commission wants registration costs for B-doubles and road trains to rise by 37 per cent, and fuel taxes for heavy trucks to climb by 10 per cent.
The Federal Government, along with the ACT, South Australia and Tasmania have already said they will vote against the charges.
Ben Fargher from the National Farmers Federation, says the increases go beyond cost recovery for the trucking sector, and farmers will end up wearing them.
"We need the most efficient freight transport task, the most efficient mode in this country and we need to look at the policy between road and rail," he said.
"Indeed the Productivity Commission has just been tasked with looking at that.

Oil-for-food inquiry terms widened
The Federal Government has widened the oil-for-food inquiry, to include an internal AWB investigation into the allegations that kickbacks were paid to Saddam Hussein.

Cyclone Larry devastates FNQ farms
The most powerful cyclone to cross the north Queensland coast in 20 years is continuing to cause havoc as it moves west.
The core of the category 5 Cyclone Larry crossed the coast near Innisfail, around 7:00am AEST, with wind speeds of 290 kilometres an hour.
Banana grower Naomi King says their property has taken a heavy battering.
"We've lost most of our trees, we've lost a fair bit of the car shed, we've lost another shed just over from our house and it looks like the iron on the lime shed just over the back of the house is lifting up too," she said.

Farmers shouldering vegetation cost, says McGauran
The Federal Agriculture Minister has told a national conference that farmers are bearing too much of the cost of conserving native vegetation.
The Vegetation Futures Conference at Albury in southern New South Wales is looking at how to balance conservation with production on farmland.
More than 400 scientists, government representatives and land managers are attending the four-day conference.
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran threw the cat amongst the pigeons in his opening address, saying that some state legislation is too focused on protection, sacrificing farm production.
He has announced funding of $2 million over the next two years for pilot projects to develop more flexible approaches to managing native vegetation.
The project will look at things like incentive payments and offsets.
He has also launched a comprehensive database containing information about Australia's native vegetation.
Meanwhile Mr McGauran has rejected suggestions the Government could buy water from irrigators to improve the health of the Murray River.
Parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has floated the idea to meet the targets of the Living Murray program, because not enough water savings have been found.
But Mr McGauran says it is too early to talk about entering the water market.

Japan's mad cow case worries cattle industry
The Cattle Council is worried about a consumer backlash against beef in Japan, after the latest outbreak of mad cow disease.
Japan has confirmed its first case of the disease in cattle specifically raised to provide meat.
All 22 previously confirmed cases of the disease were in dairy cattle.
Council President Bill Bray says Japan is our biggest customer for beef exports, and the Japanese consumer is very conscious of food safety.
"It is a concern, it's a wagyu cow that's some 14 years old and it is the 23rd case that's been identified in Japan," he said.

Record-busting market growth expected to continue
Analysts are predicting the Australian sharemarket will continue its record growth, after it broke the 5,000 benchmark yesterday, for the first time since listing in 1987.
Hartley's director John Featherby, says the strength of the Australian mining and energy sector bodes well for the year's trading.
"Well if you measure it by the All Ordinaries index, it's going to be pushing close to 5,500 by the end of the calendar year, in my opinion," he said.

NZ Govt accused of ignoring farmers
Wool prices are down, it is hard for dairy farmers to break even, and the government is interfering - it might sound familiar, but those concerns are coming out of New Zealand, not Australia.
New Zealand's Reserve Bank has cut its national growth forecast, citing a seven-year low in farm incomes.
And while farm businesses across the ditch contribute to 15 per cent of the economy, farmers say they are being ignored by government.
Don Nicolson, from the Federated Farmers of New Zealand, says the Government is over taxing and interfering, and it is hard to make a buck.
"You would wonder whether they take notice of us," he said.
"We have been continually telling them the same thing for many years: we don't need government assistance in our lives.
"We just need the framework to operate our business to be as free and as friendly as we can have it.

Wheat survey aims to find profitable secrets
A survey of wheat growers in Victoria's Wimmera is under way, to try to determine what makes a profitable farmer.
Despite a good harvest this year, growers were hit hard when grain prices plummeted by up to $30 a tonne.
Researchers are hoping to find out what factors enabled some farmers to make a profit, while others had to sell their crops below the cost of production.
John Williams, from the University of Melbourne, says the results will be compared with similar data from the United States.
"One of the things that I've found over the last ten years is that growers don't have a good grasp of their cost of production," he said.

Japanese BSE case compounds US beef fears
The US beef industry fears even longer odds of recovering its Japanese market, after that country's first case of mad cow disease in beef cattle.
US beef producers have always expected to have an uphill battle once Japan resumed imports from the US.
But Japan's 23rd confirmed BSE case, and the first in beef cattle, may cause even longer odds in that market.
American Meat Institute spokesman John Reddington points to recent Japanese press reports.
"It's going to be pretty difficult battle for the United States to change consumers' minds about the safety of our product.
"Our major competitor, when we get back into that market, is going to be Australia."

Higher sheep prices forecast amid steep demand
The live export industry says it will be forced to offer higher premiums to sheep producers to meet demand.
While producers have moved away from breeding heavy boat sheep towards the prime lamb market, the live trade expects increased demand for mutton in Europe.
Gary Tapscott, from the South Australian Livestock Exporters Association, says with more shipments out of the eastern states expected over the next few months, the trade will be demanding merino wethers coming into winter.

Veg growers urge greater marketing mix
Vegetable producers want to join forces with other rural industries to try to increase sales.
Peak grower group Ausveg is looking at cross-commodity marketing, as one of the ideas included in a new industry strategy.
Chief executive, John Roach, says with increasing global pressures on primary producers, the time may be right for more co-operation
"There is real leverage to be had with vegetables in particular co-marketing product with other rural commodities, such as seafood, such as meat, start making whole of meal solutions, particularly on an export focus," he said.

Calls to withdraw ministers' control over truck rego
The rail industry wants decisions on truck registration costs to be taken away from transport ministers, after they rejected a plan to increase charges on large vehicles.
The trucking industry says it could not afford the proposed 37 per cent increase in rego costs for B-doubles and road trains, and a 10 per cent rise in fuel taxes for heavy trucks.
But the rail industry says only 2 per cent of trucking operators will benefit.
Brian Nye from the Australasian Railway Association says there still needs to be fundamental reform of road and rail pricing.
"I'm not arguing that the trucking industry doesn't pay," he said.
"What we're saying is that smaller vehicles are cross-subsidising heavier vehicles and it's the heavier vehicles that are doing the damage.
"So, yes the trucking industry can say 'Yes we are paying a fair amount but it's the way the formula's worked out', and this was trying to redress some of that.
But the Victorian Transport Minister says the increases would have jeopardised rural businesses, already battling high transport costs.
Peter Batchelor says there needs to be a uniform approach to truck rego fees, and uncertainty over Federal Government funding for freight infrastructure also needs to be resolved.

Doctors warned of racial abuse in wake of Patel scandal
Overseas trained doctors are being warned against practising in rural Australia, because they could face racist abuse from both patients and colleagues.
The Australian Doctors Trained Overseas Group says fallout has not abated, after the "Dr Death" case in Queensland.
Martin Stanley, from the Rural and Remote Workforce Agencies Group, says a positive campaign about the work of overseas trained doctors is urgently needed.
"I think there is a lack of understanding," he said.
"I think there's an assumption that some communities make, that there are doctors all over the place and it's just a matter of picking one to come to their community.
"I think we all, collectively, need to keep telling some of the positive stories about what overseas trained doctors are doing in local communities."
Dr Adel Asaid trained in Egypt, and has practised as a GP in the Victorian town of Elmore for the past eight years.
But he says while getting to know the locals took some time, stories of racism in country areas are exaggerated.
"It wasn't an easy task for me, or even for the town, but the town actually was great, like the town accepted me and welcomed me so that made my life much easier," he said.

Growers count cost of cyclone Larry
Far north Queensland's horticulture industry has been almost wiped out by cyclone Larry.
The Category 5 cyclone has caused hundreds of millions of dollars damage to sugar and banana crops, along with the rest of the farming sector.
Ninety per cent of Australia's bananas come out of the Innisfail and Tully regions; at this stage most of the industry looks to have been lost.
Jan Davis from horticulture's representative group Growcom says the damage looks worse than anticipated.
"Avocados are in the middle of harvest and probably 70 to 80 per cent of that crop's gone. We've got significant damage reports coming in from tropical fruit. Very, very serious damage right across the sector," she said.
Sugar cane along the coast from Tully to Cairns also copped the blow of the cyclone, with most of the Innisfail crop which faced 290 kilometre winds destroyed.
The cyclone will have huge ramifications for jobs and local businesses in the affected districts, which heavily rely on the two crops that used to dominate the landscape: sugar and bananas.
There have been calls for the State Government to help out with compensation.
It says it is still assessing the damages.
Those heavy losses in the far north are expected to drive the price of bananas to above $40 a carton, or between $5 and $6 a kilo.
But Tony Heidrich from the Australian Banana Growers Council is concerned about how growers in far north Queensland will rebuild.
"If growers aren't making any money, they can't afford to keep staff above those which are essential to getting the farm back into production," he said.
"And the question is as far as key people go, key employees, if you do have to let some of those go, whether they come back again."
Remote cattle stations in the Gulf of Carpentaria are apprehensive over what Cyclone Larry may bring to the already water-logged region.
Stuart Zlotkowski of Wollogorang Station, says he is relieved to have turned off cattle months in advance.
In the metric scale, the station has had around 768 millimetres of rain this month, which is by far the wettest March on record and the second wettest of any month ever in about 28 years of recorded weather statistics.

Growers vote to keep wheat export's single desk
Grain growers in Victoria have formally shown their support for keeping the single desk for wheat exports.
Almost 330 growers voted to retain the single desk, at the annual Victorian Farmers Federation Grains Conference.
Grains group president Ian Hastings says it is a strong result.
"We've got a very very clear message that people want single desk and at this point in time they are not including how or who the manager will be," Mr Hastings said.
"They want single desk marketing, which is what we've been saying all along, and at the end of the Cole inquiry is the time when we will then look at what the structure will be to ensure that we have a single-desk marketing system."
Meanwhile a better outlook for crop prospects in the US has hit domestic grain prices.
Chicago wheat futures have dropped more than 3 per cent in the past 10 days, with rain and snow expected to help US crops.
Leonie O'Driscoll from Agfarm marketing says the fall is being felt.
"Already we have seen domestic end users drop their buying values by about $10 a tonne," she said.

Analysts urge consortium to move quickly on Iraq wheat deal
Grains industry analysts say Australia could lose a deal to supply hundreds of tonnes of wheat to Iraq, unless it moves quickly to seal the contract.
Media reports from Baghdad say the Iraqi Grains Board is refusing to agree to the deal unless it controls shipping arrangements, accusing Australia of over-inflating transport costs.
Analyst Lloyd George says dealing with Iraq is not a simple process.
"You know those terms and conditions can vary from customer to customer significantly and hence the risks vary with that as well," Mr George said.
"Even in the past day or so it's been talked about in the United States that Iraq is essentially looking around for another 300,000 tonnes of wheat out of the United States, which suggests they may be starting to look in other directions if business hasn't been concluded."

Anderson urges states to stand by water initiative
Former deputy prime minister John Anderson says the National Water Initiative is in danger of stalling and the states need to recommit to it.
Mr Anderson says the deal, to secure water for the environment and property rights for farmers, is months behind schedule and he is worried it is heading off target.
He has also reject suggestions that it is time for governments to buy water from farmers for the environment.
"Where they do want to enter the market in my view, they should do it as was agreed in the case of the Living Murray, as a last resort only," Mr Anderson said.
"I'm glad you asked the question because I think there's a few governments now and few people around the place thinking 'oh the easy way out of this, it's all too hard to find the savings' and I don't know what's wrong with modern governments, but they're all so reluctant to get their hands involved with infrastructure."
Malcolm Turnbull, parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister, says only half the necessary water savings have been found for Murray River environmental flows.
Mr Turnbull says there may be no other option than buying water and he will put the idea to a Murray Darling Ministerial Council meeting next month.
He is rejecting suggestions that would lead to a big increase in water prices.
"There's this kind of implicit assumption that if governments are going to participate in water markets they will do so recklessly, overpaying," Mr Turnbull said.

UN outlines farming's threat to water
A new United Nations report says farming is the biggest threat to the world's freshwater supply.
The report has been unveiled at a World Water Forum in Mexico, and recommends an end to subsidies on pesticides and fertilisers, and realistic water pricing.
But the forum has been told Australian farmers are world leaders, for using market forces to stop water wastage and pollution.
Mike Young from CSIRO Land and Water is at the forum and says Australia is recognised as a pioneer in tackling dwindling river flows, increasing contamination and pollution and damage to fisheries.
"I think we are very much at world's best practice in terms of innovations," Mr Young said.
"All of the discussions I have been involved in, people have been amazed at the approaches that Australia is taking in introducing tradeable water rights, actually moving very quickly to full cost recovery and often being there.

N Qld cyclone damage hits prawns, avocado producers
Flooding is now causing havoc in Queensland between Cairns and Townsville, in the aftermath of cyclone Larry.
Innisfail recorded 289 millimetres of rain in the 24 hours to 9am AEST, with most coastal areas receiving more than 100 millimetres.
The floods have devastated the region's prawn farming industry, which supplies 40 per cent of the Australian market.
Scott Walter from the Australian Prawn Farmers Association says there are huge losses due to flood damage and loss of power.
"Basically we have power to run our freezers where the stock is kept," Mr Walter said.
"We've got power that run aerators in our ponds, which keep the oxygen levels up to a point where the prawns are capable of basically growing and surviving, so if we lose the ability to oxygenate our ponds we'll lose our crops, and if the freezers go down for too long and the seals are broken, the temperatures will drop and we'll have to destroy the stock because it'll no longer be safe for food."
Cyclone Larry has also devastated avocado plantations on the Atherton Tablelands in far north Queensland, with losses estimated at up to $15 million.
Just last week the region supplied 80 per cent of the Australian crop.
New South Wales grower Gordon Birch says New Zealand imports are likely to fill the shortfall, until other growing regions begin picking fruit.

McCain cuts hit Vic potato farmers
Potato growers in Victoria are facing a 10 per cent supply cut and lower prices from food processor McCain this year.
Negotiations on this year's contracts started in the middle of last year and the federal industry and produce ombudsman has been called in to try to resolve the dispute.
President David Myers says it is unfair, when fuel costs have gone up for producers.
"We want a finalisation of the contracts," he said.

Telstra admits 3G upgrade will not fix all black spots
Telstra has begun upgrading 5,000 mobile phone towers as it prepares to roll out a new 3G phone network early next year.
But there are growing concerns about whether mobile phone black spots will ever get network coverage, even with the 3G service.
The technology will allow mobile phone users to access fax, email and high-speed Internet services.
Telstra's Michael Patterson says mobile coverage will improve with 3G, but concedes there will be black sports, particularly in more isolated areas.
"Absolutely but at the same time all the major communities above 350 people have mobile coverage at the moment, and we're gonna be fixing some of the black spots on the highways," he said.
"We're also working with both state and federal governments to see what sort of funding is available to roll out additional base stations."

Tas push to maintain freight subsidy
Tasmanian farmers say they will fight to keep the state's $90 million freight equalisation scheme.
The Federal Government is reviewing the scheme, which subsidises the cost of freight and passengers across Bass Strait.
While Tasmania wants the scheme strengthened, parliamentary secretary for finance Richard Colebeck will only say the Government remains committed to freight equalisation of some kind,
"It's recognised pretty generally that the method of freighting and even operations on Bass Strait have changed significantly over the last 30 years," Mr Colebeck said.

Predicted egg shortage to increase prices
There are predictions of a looming national shortage of eggs, despite an oversupply and all-time low prices over the past six months.
Those two factors, coupled with a hot summer, have led to birds being culled in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales.
Steven Todd from Southern Eggs says fewer birds means fewer eggs with prices set to rise by 20 per cent.
He says the bigger players are the ones who will benefit.

BOM to consider marine weather service's viability
The Bureau of Meteorology is review its HF radio marine weather service.
The bureau assumed responsibility for the free 24-hour service four years ago, after Telstra stopped funding it.
It services vessel operators who are a long way off shore without access to satellite technology.
The bureau's Vernon Carr says they to find out how relevant the $3 million service is.
"There are a number of alternatives available that we're looking at," Mr Carr said.
"Again technology is advancing as well and that's where we're looking as well is to see how far advanced, particularly for mariners in the open ocean, you know how technology is helping them receive this weather information.

Major supermarkets excluded from new code of conduct
The fruit and vegetable industry is angry at a decision to exclude major supermarkets from a new mandatory code of conduct.
The code was promised by the Federal Government in 2004 to try to give growers more clout in negotiating contracts with supermarkets.
But it has now decided not to include retailers Coles and Woolworths.
Andrew Young from the wholesaler-backed, Central Markets Association, believes supermarkets could end up benefiting at the expense of both growers and wholesalers.
"Over 50 per cent of the product will be outside the scope of the code so there's really a big question mark over whether it's meaningful at all, particularly given that two prior government reviews into the code issue have both recommended that if there is to be a code it should apply to the whole retail/grocery industry," he said.

Food prices to soar in cyclone's wake
Food prices could be set to soar in areas of far north Queensland devastated by cyclone Larry.
Trucks which transport fruit and vegetables from the region, usually backload with fresh produce and non-perishables from the state's south.
But with crops destroyed, the cost of carting food into the north is expected to skyrocket.
Les Blennerhassett from Blenners Transport says without assistance, freight costs could increase by 90 per cent.
"If we can't get freight subsidies from the Government our freight rates into north Queensland will double from next week, everything on the shelf's going to go up," he said.
"Every food item that's on the shelf there now from fruit and veg to ice cream back to your Wheatbix, every item that's on there all travels by road and rail.
"Rail do have a percentage of the freight and might be able to travel a little bit cheaper going back empty but they have costs also."
Meanwhile sugar millers in north Queensland are assessing damage caused by the cyclone.
Bundaberg Sugar's Mourilyan, Babinda, South Johnstone and Tableland mills all suffered significant damage.

Govt won't allow banana imports
The Federal Government says it will not relax quarantine import restrictions for bananas following the destruction of Queensland's crop by cyclone Larry.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says the current supply of local bananas is expected to run out within the next few days.
But he says reducing biosecurity checks to import bananas to meet the shortfall would hurt Queensland growers.
"We will not compromise the science to meet a short term shortage on the domestic market," he said.
"Moreover this would be the worst thing possible for the devastated banana industry that bananas came in from overseas on a faulty or hastily decided science."
Banana growers at Carnarvon, in Western Australia, say they will not bow to pressure to send fruit to the eastern states to fill the gap.
WA representative on the Australian Banana Growers Council Tom Day says they will continue to supply local markets.
"Whilst we sympathise with the people in the east there are are some bananas in New South Wales and there are still a few in Queensland," he said.
"We've got our markets in Western Australia, that's always traditionally been our market and we've got some very faithful buyers there and we want to stick with those people and help the east if we possibly can.
A new report raises doubts over the ability of the National Water Initiative (NWI) to solve the water crisis and deliver infrastructure reform.
But it says reforming rural and urban water infrastructure could add between $6 billion and $8 billion a year to the economy.
One year since conducting its first review of infrastructure policy, the Business Council of Australia (BCA) says the National Water Initiative is lacking urgency and clear direction.
The BCA found of all areas reviewed like energy and transport, only water policy did not see significant progress.
Backing comments from former deputy prime minister John Anderson, it says the NWI is missing targets, like the creation of a national water trading market and finding more barriers than solutions.
The BCA's Maria Tarrant says the organisation has given the Council of Australian Governments until the end of the year to reinvigorate the National Water Initiative and further develop water trading.

Mission Australia highlights city-country divide
Divisions between the wealth and health of city and country dwellers are continuing to grow, according to a new report by welfare group Mission Australia.
The report says rural Australians are less likely to finish school, more likely to die from alcohol abuse or be affected by domestic violence, or suffer mental illness.
Anne Hampshire from Mission Australia says the concerns will be taken to Canberra next week along with a push for new programs.
"The report actually has three components, identify the problems which we have, identify some of the great initiatives which are happening on the ground so we make sure we can develop those further, but also we've suggested a whole suite of recommendations," she said.

Probe into low Vic commodity prices
The Federal Government is setting up a taskforce to investigate the impact of low commodity prices in western and north-western Victoria.
Farmers say low grain, wool, grape and citrus prices are crippling the economies of rural communities.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says the Government will not subsidise farmers, but will try to reduce cost burdens.
Hindmarsh mayor Darryl Argall says the taskforce will give rural communities more direct contact with the Federal Goverment.

Dairy companies compete for suppliers
Competition for milk suppliers is intensifying between dairy companies in Victoria.
After years of dismal prices, milk company Fonterra is now offering a sweetener of a 50 cent per kilogram premium to new suppliers.
Doug Chant from the Victorian Farmers Federation is happy with the higher prices, but he is worried the incentives will not give farmers long-term financial security.

Woodside signs big gas deal with Japan
Oil and gas producer Woodside has signed its biggest agreement for the supply of liquefied natural gas.
The company will supply up to 2 million tonnes of LNG a year to Japan from 2011.

Biodiesel plant opens
One of Australia's biggest biodiesel plant is being opened in Adelaide today.
The was opened this morning and will be capable of producing of 45 million litres of diesel each year.
Initially this plant will be producing diesel from animal fat but it is hoped it will soon be coming from oil seeds and the plant will be looking for some 100,000 tonnes of oilseed each year.

Bio-gas plant to put cow manure to good use
A feedlot and abattoir in southern New South Wales is planning to generate electricity from cow manure.
Rockdale Beef at Yanco is developing a bio-gas plant, to make better use of 120,000 tonnes of manure produced at the feedlot every year.
General Manager Paul Troja says the $12 million plant will be one of the first of its kind in the country.
"The manure is collected and put into a digestor where the methane is extracted, the methane is cleaned then put through a gas turbine which generates electricity and hot water," he said.
"The electricity is used in the plant and the hot water in terms of our normal requirements in an abattoir operation.

NT flower growers meet Games shortfall after cyclone
Cut-flower growers in the Northern Territory have had to come to the rescue of Commonwealth Games organisers, in the wake of Cyclone Larry.
The red and orange tropical heliconias are a centrepiece of the bouquets presented to medal winners, and had been provided from both north Queensland and the Territory.
Darwin growers like Jan Hintze have had to come up with more than 10,000 blooms after the Games order doubled overnight.
"I had to find another 1,000 flowers, from Monday lunchtime to Tuesday lunchtime, which is actually quite difficult," she said.
"But however, we all got together and sure enough I did manage to get them all together and they went off on Tuesday night and they will be the bouquets today and tomorrow.

Iraq wheat sale still on track: consortium
The grain consortium Wheat Australia is hosing down speculation its deal to sell wheat to Iraq is in trouble.
Spokesman Rhys Ainsworth says the consortium this week made its tender submission to the Iraqi Grains Board, and has already started talks with the board.
While he would not be drawn on the content of discussions, Mr Ainsworth played down the time the deal is taking.
"Well it's very hard to talk about what's normal and what's abnormal," he said.
"I suppose, what I can confirm is that the initial offer has been made and discussions are continuing.
"So that's the certainly the context that Wheat Australia is proceeding with at the moment.

Moody's review pushes up AWB shares
Shares in wheat exporter AWB have surged more than 20 cents after a positive review from ratings agency Moody's.
The share price has hovered at all-time lows in recent weeks but Moody's assessment of subsidiary company AWB Harvest Finance has improved confidence in AWB's ability to handle risk.
Senior financial analyst at CommSec Grant Saligari says while it is an important review, it is expected the share price will continue to fluctuate.
"I think this is more a reaffirmation of short-term prospects at this stage," he said.
"I think you're going to see quite a bit of volatility until the outcome of the Cole inquiry is known and the Government's response to that is known."
Shares opened trading this morning at $3.97.
Meanwhile 220 grain growers have voiced their support for the single desk for wheat exports at a meeting in WA's mid-west.
Just six farmers at the gathering in Morowa wanted the single desk deregulated.
Many believe their support is not being recognised in the eastern states but David Hayes of Badgingarra says WA growers want the single desk left alone.
"I think there's a clear demonstration that Western Australian farmers are 100 per cent behind single desk," he said.
They have done the wrong thing and I think that there's going to have to be some heads roll in the AWB but at the end of the day, the rank and file of the people that work for the AWB are great people and they've got our best interests at heart."

SA barley growers vote to keep single desk marketing system
Grain growers in South Australia have voted to keep the single desk marketing system for barley.
A total of 5,900 barley growers were sent out the South Australian Farmers Federation's barley ballot, asking growers whether they wanted to retain the single desk or complete deregulation.
Only 2,000 responded.
This comes after months of debate over poor barley prices which has led to some growers demanding competition for the state's barley market.
Fourteen hundred growers voted yes to the single desk, while 300 voted to remove it but one change has resulted, with 1000 growers wanting an independent single desk, with a similar structure to the Wheat Export Authority.

Falling Aust dollar good news for farmers
In some good news for farmers, the falling Australian dollar is adding hundreds of millions of dollars to export returns.
Chief economist at Deutsche Bank Tony Meer says the dollar is at its lowest level in 18 months, trading at 71.5 US cents.
He says the drop is boosting returns in the resources sector and there are also benefits for farm commodities.
"Definitely anyone who gets to export, I am thinking resource companies but also the farm sector and the good news for the farm sector is that those broad acre croppers, those people who produce things like wheat and barley, at least they have got something to sell on those global markets this time around because of the breaking of the drought," he said.

Wool market falls off
A 3 per cent fall in the US exchange this week should have led to higher wool prices in Australia.
Instead the market has fallen off, due to poor, older wool being reoffered at sales this week.
The biggest fall was in Fremantle, where there was a 15 cent drop-off.
The eastern market indicator fell seven cents to 744 cents a kilo clean.

US lawmakers urged to oppose food aid commodities plan
US farm groups are angry at a plan by the Bush administration to spend almost a quarter of its main food aid program on Australian and European commodities.
Wheat, soy, rice and other minor crops are involved.
The groups have written to US lawmakers urging them to oppose the Bush administration's plan to buy food aid commodities from Australia and others, closer to needy areas like South-East Asia.
US Wheat Associates' Dawn Forsythe says the proposal amounts to as much as $305 million.
"Twenty-five per cent of the budget would be purchased elsewhere. Now, we have a problem with that ... with US taxpayer money going to buy competitors' products," she said.

NZ growers question Australian fire blight detection skills
New Zealand apple growers have questioned the ability of Australian quarantine workers to inspect their orchards for the plant disease fire blight.
Inspections would be carried out as part of new regulations to allow New Zealand apple imports into Australia.
Submissions on the draft regulations close next week.
But Pipfruit New Zealand's Peter Beaven says Australia does not have the skills to detect fire blight.
"The draft contemplates AQIS inspectors coming out to New Zealand and doing work that I don't think they are qualified to do, quite frankly, because you know they are going to be looking around orchards, looking for canker and so forth and they've got no experience in doing that," he said.

Live export campaign to improve welfare
Meat and Livestock Australia will fund a million dollar campaign to raise awareness of its efforts to improve animal welfare, particularly in the live export trade.
The campaign will begin in WA in a few weeks before being launched nationally, targetting consumers, metropolitan media and schools.
Tim D'arcy from the Pastoralists and Graziers Association says he hopes it will make the live export industry more transparent as well.
"You know, there are people out there who still don't do the right thing, and we're aware of that," he said.
"And we're trying to, through this process, trying to encourage everybody, to ensure their animal welfare management is of the highest order.

Dairy farmers needed for Tasmania
Tasmania's dairy industry has launched a recruitment drive to attract more farmers.
The campaign has the theme "a great place to live, a great place to dairy", and promotes not only the sound economics of dairy farming, but the lifestyle qualities of living in Tasmania.
Dairy consultant Basil Doonan says while there has been a big influx of New Zealand farmers in the past decade, this campaign targets Europeans.
"We don't mind where the investment comes from, we just need foreign investment, we need an injection of capital at the farm level in the Tasmanian industry," he said.

Dairy industry rallies behind FNQ producers
The Queensland Dairyfarmers Organisation (QDO) has set up its own cyclone relief fund to provide help to farmers affected by cyclone Larry.
The cyclone damaged infrastructure, and power is still out in many dairies five days after it hit.
Without power farmers cannot milk and cows face the possibility of mastitis and going dry.
There has been a major effort to fly in mobile milking machines, source generators and even fly in a tanker so milk that can't be chilled can be picked up every day, otherwise it has to be poured down the drain.
QDO president Wes Judd says farmers across the country have offered their help and any donations will be most welcome.

Cave on standby as waters rise in Kimberley
Residents of stations and communities in the east Kimberley are on stand-by to evacuate as rain continues to bucket down in WA's far north.
Kununurra has had double its average March rainfall, with 200 millimetres over the past two days.
Yesterday a helicopter arrived at nearby Ellenbrae Station to collect the Stanley family, although farmer Norm Stanley decided to stay on.
"I can't see anyone coming to too much grief," he said.
"We've got a big hill about a kilometre over from the homestead and I'll shoot across there if it gets too bad.

Top End crabbers facing tough times
Commercial crabbers in the Northern Territory say the industry will be forced to downsize under major new restrictions.
Thirty per cent fewer crabs will be able to be caught under amendments to the Territory mudcrab plan and there will be tougher penalties for breaching catch limits.
Chris Calogerous of Sea King Seafoods is disappointed there is no provision to buy out any of the 49 commercial licence holders.
"Most of us feel like we've been kicked in the guts. Our advice has been ignored and I can see how this is effectively going to put this industry under extreme pressure," he said.
"We support all the rules relating to tougher penalties but this size limit increase of 10 mm basically means that we're going to not be able to harvest crabs in the Gulf because a large proportion of the crabs there are always a smaller crab.

Farmers sign up to save rare cocky
Farmers are signing up in droves for a project which offers them cash for preserving the habitat of the Commonwealth Games mascot.
The Federal Government will spend more than $1 million to try to save the last 1,000 red tailed black cockatoos, found in Victoria and South Australia.
Cockies have been seen on the farm of Richard Hobbs at Clear Lake, who says protecting trees serves a dual purpose.
"We do value the trees, we think that we can crop and have trees," he said.
"We think it increases production - protection for the livestock and probably for crops too.

Rural jobs last resort for migrants: agent
There are claims today the growing social divide between city and country is making it hard to recommend rural areas to migrants.
Attracting migrants to regional areas has been touted as a solution to the skills shortage but migration agent Michael Walker says jobs in rural areas are often the last resort for his clients.
Mr Walker from Absolute Immigration Services says there is often a lack of opportunities, infrastructure and support in country areas.
"The infrastructure in many regional areas is not sufficient enough to sustain an influx of migration," he said.
"We already know that many young people who have grown up in regional areas are coming into the cities seeking employment.

Fears compo payments may restrict farmers' borrowing
Farmers who receive government-funded compensation payments are being warned they could have less leverage to borrow money from banks.
The issue has been highlighted in New South Wales, where compensation paid to ground water irrigators will be taxed as income.
Bruce Brown from Namoi Catchment Management says under the tax ruling, farmers who receive compensation for the loss of any property will see their asset base reduced.
"Banks would be seeing a loss of their loan security ratios which would obviously impact on the amounts of money they are prepared to lend because they will do their credit risk ratings etc on that," he said.

Research focuses on merino meat breeding
The merino industry is taking a stand against competition from meat sheep breeds.
While there has been plenty of study into merino wool, less is known about the sheep itself.
A five year project has been researching fertility, worm resistance, muscle and fat depth in more than 10,000 stud sheep.
South Australian breeder Robin Schwartz says the industry's future lies in being able to compete by offering good wool and meat characteristics.
"While wool prices are up and down, and more down than up at the moment, everyone is keen to kick some goals with the meat breeding side of the operations," he said.

Emerging market may help grape growers
An emerging grape seed oil market could help deal with the nation's oversupply of wine grapes
The seeds come from a by-product of wine production and the oil is used for eating and cooking, as well as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.
Rocco Rombola has established a grape seed oil extraction plant at Loxton in South Australia's Riverland and says while it is a relatively new product in Australia, it has been used in Europe for years.

AWB accused of reneging on wheat commitment
Grain traders are accusing AWB of reneging on a public commitment to relax the company's power of veto over wheat exports.
They say applications for hundreds of thousands of tonnes of wheat, including one from the consortium Wheat Australia, are held up at the Wheat Export Authority (WEA).
It is nearly a month since Trade Minister Mark Vaile told grain growers that AWB would relax its veto power to allow other companies to export to Iraq.
But applications to export more than half a million tonnes of wheat have been before the WEA for weeks, including a Wheat Australia bid to sell 350,000 tonnes to Iraq.
Under current legislation, AWB must give written authority to the WEA before any export applications can be processed.
"The authority must not give a bulk export consent without the prior approval in writing of AWB. I guess they're still waiting for that," Alick Osborne from the Grain Exporters Association said.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran is confident AWB will stand by its word.
"AWB has committed to the Government and to wheat growers to waive its veto power, they will honour that commitment," he said.

Regional workers first to feel impact of IR changes: unions
Unions say regional Australia will be the first to feel the effects of the Federal Government's new industrial relations laws.
The changes come into force today, meaning employers have more power when negotiating contracts with workers.
Dr Chris Briggs from the Workplace Research Centre at Sydney University believes regional workers will see major changes.
"These types of laws were trialled in Victoria in the mid-90s under the Kennett government and what it found is that ... things didn't change all that much in the middle of the capital cities but where they changed were in regional areas where you had three times as many low paid jobs, particularly in jobs like retail, construction and hospitality, so it is likely that regional areas will feel the effects of this," he said.
But farmers and other regional businesses say the changes will lead to more jobs in regional Australia and greater flexibility for workers and employers.
Only farms that are incorporated or in Victoria will be able to negotiate under the new laws but the National Farmers Federation (NFF) says it will be encouraging farmers to incorporate so they can access the changes.
The NFF's Denita Wawn says over time the new laws will lead to better relations between employers and employees.

Farmers expecting conditions to worsen
Confidence in rural Australia remains weak, with more farmers expecting conditions to worsen over the next 12 months.
The latest quarterly rural confidence survey from Rabobank has found only a quarter of primary producers expect the agricultural economy to improve.
Rabobank's Neil Dobbin says farmers are particularly cautious in the lead-up to the winter cropping system, with many farmers in the eastern states waiting for rain.
"Across Australia the confidence was weaker. It's mainly what they're thinking about in the future, what they see commodity prices and input costs," he said.

Beef producer set for wagyu cattle production
Australia's biggest beef producer is set to take over the world's largest breeder of wagyu cattle.
Wagyu beef is renowned for its marbling and is highly prized in the Japanese market.
The Australian Agricultural Company has bought a bull herd belonging to Ballarat-based Westholme Wagyu, regard as the world's best outside Japan.
Managing director Don Mackay says the company hopes to buy Westholme's cows and calves, embryos and semen later this year.
"You produce a higher quality beef, you produce beef products that are worth considerably more value," he said.
"Clearly you've got a higher cost of production and the animals that we feed in our feedlot today are generally on feed for about a year but those animals are worth a lot of money.
"As long as you get the right performance from the right genetics.

Tasmanian wine grapes in short supply
While the mainland deals with a massive oversupply of wine grapes, Tasmania does not have enough for this year's vintage,
The island state is short around 500 tonnes of grapes, mainly those used to make sparkling wines.
The shortage means growers are receiving a good price for premium fruit and winemaker Andrew Pirie says there are no plans to import more fruit.
"If you examine why Tasmania is now, let's say isolated and good position it's because we've stuck with a strong Tasmanian regional branding," he said.
"For 20 years now we've focused on 100 per cent Tasmanian content and that now sets us apart from the south-east Australian blend which is becoming the wine that's in oversupply, so regionality has been our saviour."
Meanwhile a new national task force will work to find niche global markets for Australian wine.
The 13 member "new directions" group will also try to build stronger ties between producers and retailers, exporters and governments.
It is part of a bid to reduce the wine surplus.
And in another development, one company is introducing tetra paks for wine, the same as those used for long-life milk and fruit juice.
Already used in Canada, a business in Victoria's Sunraysia district will become the first company in the southern hemisphere to install the technology.
Ken Henderson from Best Bottlers says the taste of the wine will not change.
"It's virtually unbreakable, it can go into places where glass is not normally allowed in such as sporting venues, beaches," he said.

Flooding hits northern WA town
A tropical low hovering over the east Kimberley has continued to dump huge falls of rain over the region.
Wyndham received 560 millimetres over the weekend, causing major flooding and forcing road closures.
Graeme Down from the Fire and Emergency Services Authority of Western Australia says flooding in the lower Ord River is reportedly the biggest ever seen.
"The local manager for SES here advised me that he pulled his pump up to one and a half metres above what he thought was the highest he had ever seen and his pump went under again," Mr Down said.
"So I think there's been a huge volume of water that the Water Corp was telling us, before the waters had really come down out of the diversion dam that they were letting 580 cubic metres per second."

Rain sets back fight against noxious weed
While pastoralists in Western Australia's Pilbara region are rapt with the wet start to the year, record rainfall has resulted in a growing problem with noxious weeds.
Mesquite is a weed with spiny thorns and covers 150,000 hectares of grazing land west of Karratha.
Linda Anderson from the Pilbara Mesquite Management Committee says the rain has put the fight against the weed back a number of years.
"It's now going to germinate a lot of the seed bank that we think that was there that we haven't seen germinate in probably the last six or seven years when we haven't had rain," she said.

Spiralling whitefly found in Darwin backyard
Efforts have begun to control a new pest species found in the Northern Territory.
Spiralling whitefly was previously restricted to Queensland but has now been discovered in a Darwin backyard.
The pest can reduce production in plants like the mango, papaya and guava but Stuart Smith from the Department of Primary Industries says it can be controlled using a natural parasite.
"This is actually an extremely effective parasite," he said.
"It is classical biocontrol in that the parasite really knocks the pest down by 80 to 90 or 95 per cent but there is just enough to survive to maintain the parasite as well as the pest populations.
"But almost always in very low populations and not enough to be damaging."

Farmers set to show off produce
Preparations are well under way for this year's Sydney Royal Easter Show.
And farmers on the state's far south cost are getting ready to show off their produce, including Noel Watson, from Bega.
He is picking giant pumpkins and says it takes more manpower than you might think.
"More than we got here. I'll be bringing the tractor down here directly to pick it up, I think that one up there is probably the biggest I have grown, it could be pulling 200 kilos," he said.

Chinese uranium deal could prompt new mining boom
Australia could be set for a new mining boom with China set to sign an agreement to explore for uranium.
China is also a step closer to buying more uranium from Australia, to feed its new breed of nuclear power plants.
Mining analyst Warren Edney, from ABN Amro, expects Chinese companies to seek joint ventures rather than stake their own claims.
"They will be able to contract sales to the Chinese nuclear power generators and potentially we may even see BHP's Olympic Dam selling to the Chinese," Mr Edney said.
"I don't think that we will see massive exports because there is not necessarily a lot of free uranium which is why the price has gone up for yellow cake.

Woodside to spend billion on Vincent oil field
Australia's largest oil company will spend a billion dollars developing the Vincent oil field, off the coast of Exmouth, in north-western Western Australia.
Vincent will produce about a fifth of Woodside Petroleum's annual oil production by the end of 2008.
Hartley's analyst Rob Brierley says Woodside has locked in oil production from Vincent for higher than the current price of crude oil.
"It's a decent oil field," he said.
"They've managed to hedge about 30 per cent of their production. Where they've got oil price locked in between $55 a barrel and $75 a barrel that's pretty healthy margin stuff."

Record floods hit gulf country
Graziers in Queensland's gulf country are still trying to assess damage caused by record floods.
Heavy rain from ex-tropical cyclone Larry has caused both the Leichhardt and Alexandra Rivers to burst their banks, covering up to 40 kilometres.
There have also been reports of sharks spotted near a homestead, 80 kilometres inland from the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Further south, Michael Crisp from Lorraine Station, says more than 250 millimetres of rain has flooded areas he never believed would go under.
"Part of our farm, our irrigated farm has been really heavily damaged," he said.
"There was up to 900 acres of corn sown and 60 or 70 acres of sorghum that had about three or four foot of water go over it and appears to be buggered altogether."
But in sharp contrast, cattle are perishing in Queensland's far south-west, because it has been so dry.

SA dams fill for first time in decade
There has been good rain across South Australia over the past few days, boosting soil moisture levels.
One farmer says his dams have filled for the first time in a decade, with more than a hundred millimetres of rain falling.
Julian Baillie near Tumby Bay on the Eyre Peninsula says it has come as a surprise.
"I sort of did a lap around earlier in the day and a lot of them which haven't had any water in them for the best part of 10 years or even more some of them," Mr Baillie said.

Blair attacks EU trade policies
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has used an address to the Australian Parliament to attack the European Union's protectionist trade policies on farm goods.
Mr Blair says despite some gains in trade reform, a tide of protectionist sentiment is still flowing around the world.
The PM has also singled out the closed trade policies of the United States and Japan, saying the future of all trade negotiations hinges on the current Doha round of talks.
"If we can't put a decent trade round in place, when it is so plain that our long-term national interest and the wider interest of the world demand it, this will be a failure with multiple consequences, all of them adverse," Mr Blair said.

AWB pool returns up
To the grains market and wheat exporter AWB has lifted its expected pool returns for the 2006-07 season by $5 a tonne.
It is also expecting an increase in returns for 2004-05 because of a lower Aussie dollar.
The National Party wants to set targets for ending the flow of urban waste water into the ocean and increasing the use of recycled water in both cities and rural areas.
The Nationals research arm, the Page Research Centre, will conduct a study into recycled water to see if reused water could help attract and keep industries to regional centres.
Chair of the study, Queensland Nationals president, Bruce Scott says there needs to be greater debate on community attitudes to recycled water.
"What I do know is that there are so many communities that are on water restrictions almost year round now and there are communities in regional areas that are unable to attract new industries to those towns because they don't have any water to offer those industries," Mr Scott said.

Mixed response to wool contract system
A new contract selling system for superfine wool has had a mixed response from producers at the first of a series of nationwide meetings.
Under the plan, specific fibres would be supplied to customers through direct marketing, rather than the auction system.
Frank O'Connor, from the Australian Super Fine Wool Growers Association, says he is not confident the plan will get the support or the half million dollars it needs to get off the ground.
"Not at all, but I think that's the challenge ahead of us," Mr O'Connor said.

Electronic nose could solve sheep industry woes
A small grey box could be the key to reducing fly strike, one of the sheep industry's biggest health problems.
The electronic nose is being trialed by the Sheep Cooperative Research Centre at Armidale, in New South Wales.
It detects the stench of blowfly maggots in sheep near a watering point and sends a signal back to the farm's computer.
Dr Ian Colditz says, if successful, the e-nose could help the industry save more than $160 million a year.
"The device works by having some electronic sensors that are picking up chemicals that are part of an odour and that creates an electrical signal that can be picked up by a computer and could be relayed to the farm office," Dr Colditz said.

Milk prices increase angers WA farmers
Western Australian dairy farmers are angry at milk price increases announced by dairy company Fonterra, because they say they are not enough.
Fonterra owns the state's biggest milk processor, Peter and Brownes (PB).
Farmers say the increase of 1.6 cents per litre, as well as an extra two cents a litre for production is too little, too late.
Northcliffe farmer Alan Walker says farmers should demand a fairer price.
"I would like PB suppliers to all to send a letter there, just to say how they've been treated," he said.
"The way to look at it is if only five people send a letter over there, then we may as well get back to work because nobody's worried.
"But if 105 people send a letter over there, I think the Fonterra board would have to look at that quite seriously and come back and renegotiate this situation."

Cow excema outbreak poses threat
There has been an outbreak of potentially deadly facial excema in several cow herds in eastern Victoria.
Sunburn on teats is the first sign of the disease, which is caused by fungal toxins in damp pastures.
Gippsland vet Jack Winterbottom says if left untreated there could be a major outbreak.
"We'd have dead cows, at the very least you'd have cows that would be very hard to manage in terms of being irritable perhaps not wanting to be milked, be very reluctant to have units put on teats," he said.

Pork given a health lift
Researchers in the United States have found a new way for humans to take omega 3 oils, by eating pork or bacon.
While vitamin-enriched plant-based foods have been around for years, the researchers have now bred pigs, which produce the fatty acids normally only found in fish.
Professor Randall Prather from the University of Missouri says he is confident the technology will not have the same problems as cloning procedures previously used in sheep.
"Well we used the cloning procedures so the procedures are the same, and yes sometimes you do get some animals that aren't perfectly normal," he said.
"What you saw with the sheep in the UK was the first generation, and when they had offspring the offspring were normal.

Sniffer dogs to hunt cane toads
Sniffer dogs trained to smell out cane toads will soon be introduced in north-west Australia.
Tenders have been called by Western Australia's Department of Conservation and Land Management for canine training.
The department is looking for a hardy dog to withstand the tropical conditions and regional manager Gae Mckay says it will be trialed in the scrub this dry season.
"Obviously it has to be a dog that's trainable and in particular with the cane toads we want to make it a field ready dog, so it's not just a matter of sitting sniffing luggage and so forth," she said.

Vaile confident of Iraq wheat deal
Trade Minister Mark Vaile says an important deal to sell wheat to Iraq could be completed as early as this week.
The Iraqi Grains Board told reporters overnight it had signed a contract to buy 500,000 tonnes of wheat at $US190 a tonne or around $US130 million in total.
But the consortium dealing with Iraq, Wheat Australia is not confirming details of the deal or that the Iraqi Grains Board has signed a contract.
Mr Vaile says conditions are still to be sorted through, but he believes the reported figures are close to the mark.
"I understand it is getting close, the negotiations are getting close to conclusion but there are still a number of issues left to be resolved," Mr Vaile said,
"I'm also aware that what is being negotiated is a contract for around 500,000 tonnes of Australian wheat but not being involved at the centre of negotiations I can't confirm yet that that has been concluded."
Grains market analyst Lloyd George says if the Iraq contract goes ahead, it will be a big increase on the tonnage originally proposed.
But he says the price reportedly agreed to by Iraq, casts some doubt over the deal.

WA prepares for cyclone Glenda
Western Australia's Pilbara region is bracing for severe winds and heavy rainfall as cyclone Glenda tracks down the coast.
The cyclone has been upgraded to category five and is north of Port Hedland, with warnings of wind gusts up to 200 kilometres an hour.
Weather forecaster Gavin Edmonds says by late tomorrow or Friday morning cyclone Glenda will be very close to the Pilbara coast.
"It is a very large system, one of the strongest cyclones we have seen off our Australian coast line," Mr Edmonds said.
"The estimated wind gust in near the centre are up to 300 kilometres an hour, exactly the same as Larry was prior to it approaching the coast line.

Gulf graziers appeal for assistance as floodwaters rise
Graziers in Queensland's north-western Gulf country want more state help for families affected by the worst flooding in 100 years.
Authorities fear the damage bill will run to millions of dollars after heavy rainfall in the wake of cylone Larry.
Bill Olive from Cliffdale Station says he had nearly 70 millimetres of water flow through his house and expects significant stock losses.
"I do hope that they do something to help a lot of people, especially people who are working in the area and a lot of the graziers," Mr Olive said.

CSIRO works with grain farmers on harvest predictions
The CSIRO hopes new research will give graingrowers an idea of what the season will be like six months in advance.
At the moment the Bureau of Meteorology can only give a three month outlook.
Peter McIntosh, from Marine and Atmospheric Research in Hobart, says they are a step closer to helping farmers make more accurate decisions in the lead up to harvest.
"What we'd really like to be able to do is to tell the farmer whether the climate conditions in the coming six months would be really good for growing or not," Mr McIntosh said.

DPI finds exotic tomato virus in SE Qld
Queensland officials have confirmed an outbreak of an exotic virus in tomato crops near Brisbane.
Yellow leaf curl virus has never before been found in Australia and has the potential to significantly cut production.
Chris Adriaansen, from the Department of Primary Industries, says up to 40 small farms could be affected, but says seedling nurseries that supply growers in other parts of the state are so far clear.
"Yellow leaf curl is quite a serious virus of tomatoes," Mr Adriaansen said.
"In other parts of the world where it has attacked before it's been responsible for very significant losses in some cases up to 100 per cent.

Resource industry struggles to find workers
Mining and resource companies are starting to face staff shortages as the jobs boom in rural Australia continues.
A new report says the demand for good staff is making it hard to find and retain skilled workers, and it's going to get worse.
Andrew Staite from Hudson Employment says the falling dollar and growth in China will continue to cause problems.
"It is good news but is also starting to now present lots of organisations with difficulties because the difficulty in attracting skilled workers, into certainly Western Australia and Queensland, is getting greater every day.

Mining boom apparent at NT conference
The boom in the resources sector has been reflected in a record turn-out at this year's Northern Territory mining conference.
About 200 executives from around Australia have been learning more about potential mineral and metal discoveries in the Territory.
And most agree that companies are stepping up exploration as they look to cash in on strong commodity prices.
"I'm Peter Robinson I'm a consultant I'm up here for URANEX, Uranium Exploration Group, people are starting to focus here a lot and the more they focus the more they find and the more they find the more they focus."
"John Thevissen from Mincor Resources, because we're based in Western Australia this is our first time in the Northern Territory, we've applied for ground in the Northern Territory to look for base metals copper, lead, zinc and silver."

Push for licence review after trawling company goes under
Darwin's prawn trawling fleet has been cut almost in half with the demise of a major company.
Austfish has been placed in receivership with higher operating costs, cheaper imports and season limits believed to be responsible.
It is expected most of the company's 12 boats will be withdrawn from the fleet along with those of a smaller operator, who has voluntarily entered administration.
David Carter of Newfishing Australia is calling on the Commonwealth Government to urgently buy back licences.
"We expect in the next couple of weeks, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will invite all operators in the northern prawn fishery to tender their right, that will be in the form of a buy back," Mr Carter said.

Residue concerns open up Japanese hay market
Concern over residues found in hay exported from the United States to Japan is opening up new markets for Australian farmers.
The hay exporting company Johnson Asahi wants more farmers to grow oaten hay for the Japanese market, to capitalise on Australia's clean, green image.
Spokesman Anthony Chapman says it is not yet clear what the residues found in the US hay were.

Flooded market makes life tough for citrus growers
Citrus growers say their outlook is going from bad to worse.
Growers says a large crop, a flood of cheap imported juice concentrate and shrinking export markets are preventing many from selling their fruit.
The summer crop is being dumped in southern New South Wales, with growers angry at an offer of $80 a tonne for their fruit.
Frank Battistel from Riverina Citrus says he is not confident about the future.
"I know quite a few properties that have turned off water to their trees, they just can't continue to lose profit every year like that and they need to make a decision to either keep going and lose money or just get out of the industry."
But citrus growers in the west believe China could be their salvation.
It has taken more than five years for the Chinese to approve Australian fruit imports, which will largely come from the eastern states.
WA orchardist Mark Scott says that will mean less fruit sent west.
"We compete against imports from those states here in WA every day and so that the taking fruit out from their markets will mean less competition here in WA," Mr Scott said.

European winter hits global poppy industry
The global poppy crop has shrunk, with the estimated surplus also half the size of this time last year.
An exceptionally cold European winter and smaller plantings have caused the drop.
Lindley Chopping, from the Tasmanian Poppy Growers Association, says the worldwide glut had previously equalled two and a half year's supply of opiates.
"It's down to about one and half years supply," she said.

Tough times for SA potato farmers
South Australian potato growers are facing a poor harvest, with below average yields and low prices.
Growers say there's been an oversupply of potatoes for the past three season, and there's no relief in sight.
Greg Rodert who grows potatoes for the fresh market in Bordertown, says the below cost of production prices have forced many growers to cut back on the amount they produce.
'We're down in our plantings generally through lack of finance I suppose you might say," Mr Rodert said.

Jail threat for farmers employing illegal workers
Farmers and business operators who knowingly or recklessly employ illegal workers could go to jail under new laws announced by the Federal Government.
Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone says there are around 46,000 overstayers in Australia, many working illegally to support their stay.
But Senator Vanstone says only employers and labour suppliers who deliberately assist or exploit illegal workers need to fear the laws.
Farmers have been the target of Immigration Department raids, especially fruit and vegetable growers who often struggle to find enough seasonal labour to pick crops.
The National Farmers Federation (NFF) says very few growers deliberately employ illegal workers.
And the NFF's Denita Wawn says there is protection in the laws for farmers who unwittingly employ illegals.

Fuel prices set to rise
Fuel prices are set to hit last year's record highs.
The price of both petrol and diesel is up in many parts of the country, blamed on the rising price of crude oil and the falling value of the dollar.
But Geoff Trotter from Fuel Track says traditionally fuel prices are at their highest at Easter and it is not good news this year.

Glenda heads toward Pilbara coast
Western Australian mining communities are on red alert as tropical cyclone Glenda approaches the Pilbara coast.
The industry has come to a standstill as it prepares for gale force winds and possible flooding from the category 4 cyclone.
Iron ore boats which were loading in the Dampier Port have been sent out to sea to try to avoid the path of the cyclone.
Harbour master Vic Justice says inside the port all the berths are empty and equipment has been tied down.
"The vessels at the various terminals as they completed loading they sailed to put out to sea and get sufficient sea room to ride out the cyclone," he said.

Cyclone recovery expected to take months
In far north Queensland and the Gulf country, communities are still trying to come to terms with the impact of cyclone Larry.
The community has donated $10 million to help but the recovery will take months, if not years.
Cyclone Larry is said to have cost 4,000 jobs, many of them on farms and there is a concern young people will exodus the region in search of work.
AgForce has expressed concerns that flood affected graziers may not be able to access assistance if it is means-tested because of the increase in property valuations.
The Bundaberg Sugar Company will not open its Mourilyan mill south of Innisfail for this year's cane crush, saying Larry has drastically reduced the harvest forecasts.
Cane will be diverted to other mills and farmers calling for assistance to remove trees and debris from the orchard have been told by cyclone recovery task force coordinator General Peter Cosgrove that the Army will help if they put up a strong enough case.
"I would like those people who are suffering those frustrations and wonder if they can get urgent assistance to refer it to the incident management centre in Innisfail," he said.
Meanwhile cyclone Larry is being blamed for a temporary shortage of fish in Victorian markets.
Peter Clarke from the Lakes Entrance Fishermen's Co-op says there has been rough weather since the cyclone hit Queensland last week.
Mr Clarke says with winds of more than 30 knots, smaller trawlers are staying in port more days a week than usual.

More professionals choosing part-time work in regional areas
New figures show balancing work and family is beginning to bite in rural professions already short of staff.
Research by the Australian Rural and Remote Workforce Agencies shows doctors, vets and teachers are increasingly choosing to work part-time.
Almost 40 per cent of country GPs work half a full-time shift.
But spokeswoman Martina Stanley says it can be a positive in attracting professionals to country areas.
"We're trying to achieve a system whereby we can support them so that they don't have to work the way that doctors did once upon a time," she said.
"The impact is felt more significantly in rural areas because traditionally rural doctors have worked longer hours on average than metropolitan doctors.
The Nationals want more safeguards to protect the diversity of regional news services before they will support media ownership changes.
The Federal Government wants to let media owners operate across radio, television and print, leading to fears of consolidation in rural areas.
But Nationals leader Mark Vaile says businesses must be protected from increased advertising costs, while community groups must have access to locally-based newsrooms.

McCain, potato growers settle price row
After nine months, Victorian potato growers have finally reached a price agreement with food processor McCain.
The company had been offering lower prices, which farmers said would make the industry unviable.
The McCain Growers Group says neither farmers nor the company are happy with the deal because there was compromise on both sides.
Chief executive Tony Pitt says growers have accepted $2.75 a tonne less than last year's price.
"There is a price now that will operate now for 2006 deliveries and also for 2007 and that price will be $227.25," he said.

Potato growers to maintain crop production
Tasmanian potato growers have welcomed new crop contracts from the processor, Simplot and now expect to maintain crop production at recent levels.
Last year Simplot told growers there would be price and volume cuts when McDonald's awarded a major french fry contract to New Zealand growers.
But Dennis Leonard from the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association says the situation has improved.
"Simplot got on their front foot and went out and chased down some new markets, which has been of benefit to a lot of growers in the State," he said.

Highway upgrade to improve flood prone section
The Federal Government has announced plans to improve road train access between central Australia and Queensland.
A $2 million upgrade will improve a flood prone section of the Plenty Highway, which links Alice Springs to cattle markets in the east.
But there are no plans to seal the road, which some road trains refuse to use.
Central Australian pastoralist Dick Cadzow says it is a good start but more is needed.
"Any improvement that they do to that road is a big help," he said.
"I can give you an instance here, six decks coming down the other day, we could not get over 30 kilometres an hour.

Levy to pay for rail upgrade angers grain growers
Farmers on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula are angry at a proposed grain levy to pay for a regional rail upgrade.
Up to $40 million will be spent upgrading road and rail, and farmers are being asked to contribute $2 million.
The Regional Development Board says dollar-for-dollar federal funding could be jeopardised if farmers do not support the 50 cent per tonne levy.
While there has been some support, most attending a grain grower forum at Cummins objected to it.
"I just think we're being conned," one farmer said.
"The buck stops at the farmer's gate and we're regarded as a bit of a cash cow.
"Everytime they want money they seem to think 'oh well we'll just whack a levy on for a while'."

Salinity threatening Barossa Valley: expert
An Adelaide professor says one of Australia's most renowned grape growing regions could be infested with salt in 10 years.
A professor in meteorology at Flinders University, Peter Schwedtferger, says grape growers need to minimise irrigation in the Barossa Valley.
He says saline water is being piped from local reservoirs, which is already causing problems.
"If the Barossa is over irrigated with this relatively saline water that's currently being used, the Barossa's life is going to be limited," he said.
"Once the really serious saline infestation occurs it's going to be too late."
But one of the Barossa's biggest grape growers, Ed Schild, says salinity is not a problem and estimates only half a hectare is affected by salt.

Cattle station sells for nearly $40m
A Kimberley cattle station has sold in what is believed to be one of the region's biggest sales.
A WA agricultural company has handed over almost $40 million for the historic Moola Bulla Station, its 35,000 head of cattle and 300 working horses.

Radical changes to wheat export system may cost millions
The Grains Council says making radical changes to the wheat export system before this season's harvest could cost the industry half a billion dollars.
Ahead of releasing a blueprint on the future of the single desk next week, the Grains Council says it will be calling for AWB to retain control of selling this season's harvest.
The council's David Ginns says despite the obvious concerns over AWB, it is still the best company to manage Australia's wheat exports in the near term.
"It's not just something you can say 'ok let's make a change tomorrow'," he said.
The council says AWB and other traders have invested millions of dollars based on AWB's control of the pool and any sudden change will hurt growers.
Mr Ginns has also angrily rejected a report suggesting growers want this year's harvest underwritten to the tune of a billion dollars by the Federal Government.

US reaches agreement with Japan to reopen beef market
US Department of Agriculture (USDA) officials says they have reached an agreement with Japan on steps to reopen that country's beef market.
Imports of US beef were suspended in January after a shipment of veal was found to include bone material prohibited by the Japanese.
USDA acting under-secretary Chuck Lambert told a Senate panel his team has answered Tokyo's remaining questions about January's foul-up at a New York veal plant and set in motion steps to resume beef trade, starting with a plant safety checklist.
"Once that takes place, we will have people in the plants and do those verification audits, just as fast as we can," he said.
"That probably will take in the neighbourhood of a week to 10 days, to two weeks.
"And then, the next challenge will be to get the auditings from Japan in, to do the verification visits."
And Mr Lambert says Tokyo has agreed to do outreach with Japanese consumers to outline the changes and reassure them of the safety of US beef - a significant turnaround if true.
Meanwhile beef from the United States is being sold at a 20 per cent discount into Australia's fourth biggest market, Taiwan.
Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) says beef sales from Australia are not being affected and does not think the Americans are likely to try the same tactic in the much bigger Japanese market.
Tim Kelf from MLA says food quality and safety are likely to be the issues in Japan, not the price.
"The retailers are being very cautious about just jumping back into American product, the Japanese are not going to rush back to American product," he said.
"I wouldn't necessarily have agreed with that 12 months ago but I think that this time the Japanese consumer from my previous experience many years ago are fairly twitchy.

Govt clears way for Snowy Hydro sale
There has been heated debate in Federal Parliament, with the Government clearing the way to sell its 13 per cent share of the Snowy Hydro Electricity Scheme.
The Government and Opposition support the sale but the Nationals' Kay Hull and independents oppose it, saying privatisation could harm irrigator water entitlements and environmental flows.
Member for New England Tony Windsor says the Government has rushed through the sale motion without enough public consultation.
"There are so many unknowns in terms of the Murray Darling system that this is not the time to place into private hands an instrumentality that can have an impact on environmental and water entitlement needs of that system," he said.

Pilbara escapes major cyclone damage
Western Australia's Pilbara region has escaped major damage from cyclone Glenda despite the category 4 storm reaching speeds of 180 kilometres an hour.
The cyclone crossed the coast last night at Mardie Station, a cattle property 100 kilometres west of Karratha.
After enduring five hours of deafening winds, Mardie pastoralist Richard Climas now has a big clean job up on his hands.
"There's a bit of carnage around, we've got doors off sheds. A big shed door, they're hangar doors so they're pretty big doors and one of them come loose and we happened to be looking out the window and see it go flying past," he said.
"And got a few of the solar panels have blown over actually bent the 50 millimetres square steel, just bent it like toothpicks, so got a bit of work this morning."
Big rainfall from cyclone Glenda is expected to increase the threat of locust plagues in WA.
Entomologist Kevin Waldon says there are already a large number of locusts across the State's agricultural regions.
He is warning farmers to be vigilant because there is a risk that locusts will survive until the beginning of seeding.
"Given the green conditions we've got now, I expect the locusts will survive at least five to six weeks," he said.

Brisbane company to take majority stake in US ethanol producer
A Brisbane-based company will take up a 60 per cent stake in the United States' biggest farmer-owned ethanol producer.
Farmer members of Midwest Grain Processors in Iowa voted to support Global Ethanol's bid this morning.
David Nelson from Midwest Grain Processors says the deal will lead to a massive expansion of ethanol production both in the US and Australia.

More incentives needed to biofuel take-up
A sustainable energy expert says there are not enough incentives for country people to start using biofuels.
While 75 per cent of the world's renewable energy projects are based in the country, Matthew Rosser from WA's Sustainable Energy Association says it is cheaper for farmers to buy diesel under the current tax system.
He says the demand for biofuels will come from city consumers, who do not get fuel exemptions.
"For the agriculture sector, the incentive to move towards biofuels isn't as strong as what it would be for consumers within the metropolitan areas," he said.

Mixed reaction to airport ID cards
Security at regional airports is being stepped up from today with the introduction of compulsory identification cards for all staff.
All airport workers from pilots to cleaners will need clearance from ASIO, the Department of Immigration and the Federal Police.
But not everyone is happy.
Sonja Mitchell from aviation company Sling Air, in the far north of Western Australia, says the cards are a huge cost and it is difficult to justify the security benefits,
"All it means really is extra cost, It has no obvious safety or security benefit at all, especially in a town like Kununurra," she said.
"We don't have fencing around the airport perimeter, there is fencing up to a point where the jets in at the airport terminal, the rest is just the same as usual. It's only an added cost of $180 per staff member that needs to go airside."

Fruit exports to Taiwan set to resume
The Federal Government says table grape and citrus exports to Taiwan are set to resume.
The trade was halted at the start of the year because of Taiwanese concerns about Queensland fruit fly.

Growers reject latest NZ apple bid
Apple and pear growers have rejected New Zealand's latest bid to export apples to Australia.
Submissions closed yesterday on a new draft risk import analysis which would allow New Zealand apples into the country.
But growers like Tom Quirke from Loxton, in South Australia, say the risk of the disease fireblight is still too great.
"The last thing we need is to have something further to cause an industry to become unviable and that's exactly what would happen if New Zealand apples arrived in Australia," he said.
"It's not if we got fire blight but when we get fire blight. It's too much of a risk. We could never support that."

Wool market falls
The wool market has again fallen away due to the quality of wool on offer at sales this week.
The eastern market indicator dropped six cents, to finish at 738 cents a kilogram clean.

New mulesing alternative may help make lambs fatter
Australian Wool Innovation says alternative mulesing methods are helping lambs to gain weight faster.
Mulesing involves removing a fold of skin around the breach area, and has been targetted by animal welfare groups as inhumane.
AWI has been trialling a clip and an injection system, which removes wool from the breach and tails of lambs.
Spokesman Scott Williams says lambs with the clips grew to 26 kilos, while the mulesed lambs grew to 24 kilos, but he is warning growers about getting too excited.
"The growers we're working with recognise that we're in the research and development phase," he said.

Shearing course targets keen teens
Teenagers in Victoria are being given a taste of life in the shearing shed, as the industry tries to save thousands of dollars on wasted training.
Woolgrower levies have funded the course, which is designed to attract the best novice shearers, and stop trainees dropping out once they discover they do not like the work.

Town to feel impact of workers' sacking, says union
The sacking of 29 workers at an abattoir at Cowra in central western New South Wales is fuelling debate over the Federal Government's new workplace relations laws.
Unions say the workers have been told they can apply for 20 new positions, with a $200 a week pay cut.
Charlie Donzow from the Meat Industry Employees Union says the whole town will feel the impact.
"By reducing workers' income, it means that it reduces the overall expenditure within the immediate town and area so that does have a flow-on effect to the overall town economy," he said.
"Now the new Workchoices legislation unfortunately allows companies to take this position because they can simply claim it's because of operational reasons."

Govt urged to take its time negotiating China FTA
Farmers are warning the Federal Government to take its time negotiating a free trade deal with China after a push by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to accelerate talks.
China's demand for Australian farm produce has tripled in the past decade and is now worth more than $3 billion to local farmers.
Premier Wen is in Canberra to among other things push the free trade negotiations forward.
But Ian James from vegetable grower group Ausveg is warning slow and steady could be better approach.
"Our concerns would be that in the past that basically Australian agriculture probably hasn't done as well as what most people would have expected," he said.
National Farmers Federation president Peter Corish says farmers want a deal soon but not at the expense of a complete agreement which includes farm goods.
"That of course is a good thing for Australian agriculture as long as we get a comprehensive deal that includes agriculture at the end of the day," he said.
Trade Minister Mark Vaile says he will not be rushed and will only settle for a comprehensive deal that includes agriculture.
Meanwhile the uranium industry says it welcomes a move to export yellowcake to China but will not support price regulation.
Premier Wen has floated the idea of price fixing to stop the cost of uranium rising too high like other raw materials including coal and iron ore.
But Ian Hore-Lacy from the Uranium Information Centre says resource deals are commercial contracts, driven by market forces.

Plantation trees may contribute to greenhouse gas levels
New research suggests plantation trees could actually contribute to greenhouse gas levels rather than lower them.
A report in the international science journal Nature says the trees emit methane.
It was previously thought methane emissions from plants came from areas where oxygen was limited, like rice paddies.
Research scientist Philip Polglase says while the finding was totally unexpected, it is not necessarily alarming.
"What we in Ensis have done recently is compare expected rates of methane release from tree plantations with the rates of carbon uptakes," he said.
"The amount of methane released is only a very small amount or the carbon equivalent taken up. We think it's about less than 5 per cent.

Judges notice impact of climate change on wine quality
The quality of wines world-wide is being affected by climate change and critics and judges are already noticing the changes.
That is the consensus from a world conference on climate change and wine in Europe.
An Australian speaker at the conference, Dr Richard Smart, says industry leaders are already planning for big shifts in varieties grown in established wine regions.

Better disease reporting systems urgently needed: academic
A leading health academic says humans are at a greater risk of contracting diseases like the plague, Ross River fever, SARS and HIV because health authorities are not properly tracking diseases carried by animals.
Professor Peter Curson says humans now often come into contact with wild animals and developments like housing estates on former farmland increase the risk of exposure to disease.
He says better reporting systems are urgently needed.
"One classic example of this is how we collect or survey information about infection in animals and how that is done independently from collecting material about disease in humans," he said.

Concerns mount over wool quality
Concerns are growing in the wool market over the amount of pool quality wool on offer.
Despite a weaker Australian dollar, the market has dropped significantly in recent weeks.
Mike Crooks from Elders says quality issues need to be addressed to lure buyers back.
"We've got a lot of tender wool and old wool coming onto the market as a percentage of the overall catalogue and countries, other than China, are really not in there going like we know they can be," he said.

Grain growers expected to approach plantings with 'caution'
High fuel and fertiliser costs, a low Australian dollar and global grain prices will affect plantings for this season's grains crops.
Forecasters say most farmers are expecting average seasonal conditions but there is still uncertainty about expected prices.
Plantings of wheat, barley and canola are all tipped to be similar to last season.
Ron Storey from Australian Wheat Forecasters thinks many growers will play it safe.
"I think a lot of farmers are still under financial pressure. Whilst in a yield sense last year didn't turn out too badly, across Australia, the prices of course were very, very low around harvest time so people are pretty nervous about that and they'll be looking for a recovery year this year and approaching it with quite a bit of caution I'd think," he said.
With average rain, Mr Storey's forecasting a national wheat crop of around 22 million tonnes for the 2006-07 season.
And there is some good news, a drop in forecast corn plantings in the US is expected to lead to improved wheat prices.
While less corn will be grown, there is expected to be high demand for the crop from the growing ethanol industry.

WA's north-west mops up after Glenda
Western Australia's north-west is mopping up after its fourth cyclone of the year which has spared the region from major damage or flooding.
When category 4 cyclone Glenda crossed the coast late last week it dumped hundreds of millimetres of rain, sparking fears of rising rivers and flooding, however most areas have escaped unscathed.
Carnarvon banana growers are thanking their lucky stars Glenda petered out before it hit the region, sparing the region's banana crops.
Grower Bruce Munro says it was a nervous wait on Thursday evening.
"We did really well. We copped a little bit of wind, there's an odd bunch down but we survived very well," he said.
Meanwhile the region's mining industry is also mopping up.

Dept to lease out ag research stations
In a major shake-up, Western Australia's Department of Agriculture is planning to lease out its 13 agricultural research stations to farmers.
Spokesman Rob Delane says the stations are too small and not productive enough to allow leading research work.
"A small department of agriculture research station with a couple of hundred hectares of bulk crop is not the place to demonstrate leading cropping techniques when our neighbours have got properties five and 10 times our size," he said.

'Self-promotion' needed in agriculture industry
Agriculture's future leaders say the industry has to do more to promote itself.
More than 30 young people have taken part in a Young Rural Leaders' Course in Canberra and believe the farm sector is marred by the image of drought-stricken farmers.
They also believe urban consumers do not understand what role farmers plan in producing their food.
Victorian winemaker and lamb producer BeN Clifton says agriculture needs to get proactive.
"Self-promotion is the best way to do it," he said.
"We've got a good product and I know in my region, especially in north-east Victoria, we are absolutely spoilt almost every season even with the wine in the area.
"There's not a single wine style in Australia that can be made that can't be made in north-east Victoria but we have to tell people that.

Age no barrier to competitive wood chopping
Competitive wood chopping might be considered a young bloke's game but an 84-year-old Tasmanian has shown age is no barrier.
Retired tree feller and former wood chop title holder Henry Munday was a crowd favourite at the Hamilton Show north of Hobart at the weekend.
While he took almost five minutes longer than his competitors in the wood chop, he got there in the end, with the help of an old mate.
"That's an old plum axe, one of the old American plums, it's like me, it's pretty old," he said.
"But it's not a big axe, I don't use real big axes.
"I'm not strong enough now like those other big fellas out there to use big heavy axes so I use the lighter one.

Central Australian cattle head west
Central Australia's beef producers are reaping the benefits of recent heavy rainfalls in Western Australia.
Despite the rising freight costs, WA pastoralists are buying cattle from the centre as they look to cash in on the best season in years.

New crop varieties double yields in East Timor
New crop varieties being trialled in East Timor have doubled yields.
Maize is the stable crop along the rugged country on the doorstep of Darwin and harvest is now under way.
In the steep uplands of Liquica overlooking the capital of Dili, some maize farmers have recorded yields of up to three tonnes per hectare.
That is twice the average and is the result of five years of research and collaboration under the Seeds of Life project, which includes rice, casava, sweet potatoes and peanuts.
This Australian-funded initiative aims to improve nutrition and wellbeing amongst the subsistance-farming families of this newly-independent nation.

Wine grapes oversupply to impact on company profits
The global oversupply of wine grapes is starting to hurt the industry's big companies.
The world's largest wine business, Constellation, is tipped to announce a lower than expected profit to the New York Stock Exchange later this week.
US wine industry forecaster John Fredrickson says the global market is in a down phase, particularly for countries producing cheap bulk wine.
But he says in Australia, the answer is not in growing fewer grapes.
"You start to talk about pulling grapes, well that is really drastic, that means you have some other alternative and I don't think it is going to be any huge percentage of vineyards that run into that kind of extreme difficulty," he said.
Meanwhile a new research program for the wine industry will develop new export markets and create wine to suit specific tastes.
The Grape and Wine Research Development Corporation is using federal funds to investigate the wine tastes of consumers in countries like China, India, Eastern Europe and South America.
Professor of wine marketing at the University of South Australia, Larry Lockshin, says packaging, labelling, pricing and wine styles will also be considered.
"We're not going to come up with an answer that says, 'this is the wine for China'," he said.
"We're going to come out with the same thing scientists have come out with.
"This is, these are yeasts and these are the flavours they produce, these are pruning and canopy training techniques, this is what they do to your tannin levels.
"We're going to develop a method. Companies will then be able to decide whether they want to use it to develop wines for their own brands that suit different markets."
And the Victorian Farmers Federation wants better regulation of tax incentive schemes to stop oversupply problems.
President Simon Ramsay says the schemes have contributed to over-investment in vineyards, leading to an oversupply of wine grapes.
He says in south-west Victoria tax incentives for timber plantation investors seem to have affected normal competition for land.
"What we don't want to see is good traditional agricultural farming land being turned into plantations that have a sort-of unclear 12 year profit period where we are not allowing the food and fibre production to continue for generations," he said.

Farmers warned about loss of single desk for wheat exports
Farmers have been warned that grain prices could drop dramatically if AWB loses control of the single desk for wheat exports.
AWB International director Clinton Starr told a meeting of graingrowers at Murtoa in Victoria last night, that the company has secured a $13 per tonne premium each year through the single desk.
He says farmers should be very concerned about any plans to change the single desk after the Cole inquiry and AWB's experience in managing the system is as valuable to growers, as the single desk itself.
"I don't say that that is the only structure that can deliver that," he said.
"But what I would say is that if you change it you have to be very careful when you change or you effect change because in fact a lot of it is wrapped up in the intellectual and brain power of the people you employ to deliver the excess returns to you."
Meanwhile India is looking to import a further 1.5 million tonnes of wheat this year.

Tribunal rejects call for southern bluefin tuna ban
A conservation group's attempt to ban the export of southern bluefin tuna from Port Lincoln in South Australia has failed.
The Humane Society International (HSI) put a case to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for tuna exports to be banned because it believes the species is endangered.
But after three years of public consultation, the tribunal has upheld the Federal Government's decision to allow exports to continue.
Tuna Boat Owners Association president Brian Jeffriess says no-one else agreed that tuna was at risk.
"The court didn't think so, the Minister didn't think so, the public process didn't think so," he said.

US joins call for end to dairy subsidies
The US has joined Australia and other major dairy exporting countries to call for an end to subsidies, which they say are crippling legitimate trade.
The Global Dairy Alliance has written to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), also calling for greater market access by 2010.
Chairman of the Australian Dairy Industry Council, Allan Burgess, says having support from a heavily subsidised farming country like the US gives the campaign a stronger voice.
"And they still have certain levels of subsidy there and if the WTO changes take place they'll be reduced substantially," he said.

Goat abattoir lays off 140 in quarantine dispute
Australia's largest goat abattoir in western Queensland has temporarily closed to address animal welfare concerns.
In November, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) required repairs to flooring in the abattoir's forcing yards, which were not carried out.
Managing director of Western Exporters Neil Duncan says he has been forced to lay off 140 workers, including 20 Vietnamese workers on special visas.
He says they will be left without an income and without access to Centrelink payments.
"They're not able to access anything, there again we're looking into that at this stage to see how we can help everybody out, they still will be employed by the company but how and where we're going to do it, I'm just not quite sure at this stage," he said.
"We will make every effort to get everybody back to work as soon as possible."

Sheep succumb to lupinosis outbreak
Two hundred sheep have died on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula, which is experiencing its worst outbreak of lupinosis in 20 years.
Twelve sheep producers have reported deaths, with come cattle suffering symptoms as well.

Central Australian beef producers benefit from WA rain
Central Australia's beef producers are reaping the benefits of recent heavy rainfalls in Western Australia.
Despite the rising freight costs, WA pastoralists are said to be buying cattle from the centre as they look to cash in on the best season in years.
Alice Springs livestock agent Herby Neville says it is the first time in four years that he has seen central Australian cattle heading west.
"They're experiencing a very, very good season over there and I think it's given the Pilbara and all that Western Australia, the Gascoyne and all that a very good drink," he said.
"And because of their flush of the season over there, they sometimes come over here and get a bit excited and buy a few cows and calves."
But agents in the west believe pastoralists are more likely to look to the Kimberley for cattle, because of the high cost of transport.
WA pastoral livestock manager Eric Broad says despite this year's high rainfall not everyone can afford to restock.
"It's an interesting question, there's a belt of country that's been hammered for about five years without any rain. And they're the ones that are really low down in numbers," he said.

Lessons learnt from mad cow epidemic
The discovery of mad cow disease has taught scientists how to better manage disease and improved how farmers and industry respond to new virus outbreaks.
It has 10 years since the link was discovered between mad cow disease in cattle and CJD in humans, with billions of dollars spent in control and research ever since.
Professor Colin Masters from the University of Melbourne says science has learnt many lessons from the mad cow epidemic.
"We've learnt a lot about risk minimisation and disease management," he said.
"If we've learnt anything at all we should have learnt that it's not a good thing to feed one species back to itself.
"In Europe it's been virtually outlawed, the situation in North America is different, they're watching very carefully what's happening in Europe and they're taking what appears to them to be appropriate measures at this time."

Dam to house turtle hatchery
The new Paradise Dam in south-east Queensland is soon to be the home of a world-first turtle hatchery.
Concerns were raised over the future of the endangered elseya turtle during construction of the dam on the Burnett River, south-west of Bundaberg.
But the new hatchery is designed to restore turtle numbers, with thousands of baby hatchlings expected to be released over the next five years.
Craig Thamm from the Burnett Dam Alliance says attacks on eggs and hatchlings by predators is the single biggest risk to the turtle's future.
"Particularly your feral predators such as foxes and pigs are [preying on] the eggs and you're getting very few, if any hatchlings back into the river," he said.

New plan calls for changes to single desk wheat exports
AWB would lose control of the single desk for wheat exports and its power to stop rival companies from exporting wheat, under a new plan released at Grains Week.
The report, prepared for the Grains Council, also calls for the Wheat Export Authority to be replaced with a grower-owned licensing and marketing body called Australian Wheat Associates.
Report author Colin Benjamin says the Cole inquiry shows the wheat export system is failing and growers risk losing control of their sector unless they accept major changes.
"To get into a global competitive game you've got to be playing in the league of your competitor and you've got to be strategic," he said.
"US Wheat Associates has been the long term major league champion fighting us which we have successfully beaten to a pulp over the decade, we now have to be seen as fighting on a level playing field, prior to the Doha Round because if we don't, we will have it imposed upon us."
The Grains Council says Australian Wheat Associates would be modelled on industry bodies for the meat and dairy sectors.
The Council says that would give AWB's current veto powers to growers, along with its responsibility to market and promote Australian wheat.
Chairman Murray Jones says if the changes are adopted, they will be implemented over three years.
"The last thing growers want is to have an abrupt change," he said.
"It just can not happen. It's just not going to work, it will affect our financial system, growers want security and planning, they want to know their finances are secure, they want to be assured they're going to get their payments, they want to have a transparent system they can see through. That's what they're asking for."
Meanwhile five US farm state senators have asked the Bush administration to investigate AWB payments to former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
The group also wants AWB sanctioned if it is found to have violated US trade law or World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.
The senators cite the findings of a UN audit of AWB, which found it paid some $220 million in alleged kickbacks to secure wheat contracts through the UN oil-for-food program.
Top Senate Agriculture Committee Democrat Tom Harkin's spokesman Dave Townsend says US farmers should not have to compete with foreign governments in trade.
"It's clear that there were gross violations of the UN oil-for-food program by the Australian Wheat Board and we feel that the US Government needs to make a determination whether the law was broken," he said.

Gold price increase may force jewellery manufacturing overseas
If you are in the market for a gold wedding band, you had better be prepared to pay more.
The price of June spot gold hit $US596 an ounce this week, putting enormous pressure on Australian jewellery makers.
John Howie, from the Australian Jewellers Association, says at current gold prices, manufacturers will be forced to up the price of jewellery and get their designs made overseas at a lower cost.
"Many Australian manufacturers have bitten the bullet and decided that really what they have to do is design here and use the quality we have in design and manufacture overseas," he said.
"It's the same as the footwear industry and the clothing industry, we just have to find other ways to do it."
Those high gold prices and advances in exploration technology are driving a new gold boom in Victoria.
Ballarat Goldfields has attracted $50 million in international investment to ramp up its production.
And while the Stawell gold mine was being wound down before it was taken over by Leviathan Resources, exploration manager John Dugdale says it is now expanding.
"The grade we try to keep up to the mill is five and six grams of gold to the tonne," he said.

Minister confident forest scheme will hold up to scrutiny
Federal Forestry Minister Eric Abetz is confident that Australia's Forest Standard will be upheld after a UK Government review.
The UK has placed a number of global forest certification schemes on probation while it reviews guarantees that the wood is sustainably and legally harvested.
Senator Abetz is rejecting suggestions that Australian forest products have been banned and is confident that the Australian Forest Standard will hold up to international scrutiny.
"We as a government can rely on robust, peer reviewed, scientific evidence and we will be putting the facts fairly and squarely before these governments," he said.

Ewe market remains firm
Ewe prices are going against the seasonal trend and maintaining good saleyard prices across Australia.
It is believed to be partly due to flock rebuilding after the drought and also a switch away from the high inputs and uncertainty of cropping.
Breeding stock is in demand from growers put off by narrowing grain profits.
Aaroy Yiori from the national livestock reporting service says farmers want ewes mainly for the prime lamb market.
"Re-stocker demand's pretty strong, especially on females and that's certainly one of the things that's underpinning the market," he said.

Bare bummed sheep producing better wool: expert
Research is showing that merinos which are naturally bare in the rear end produce better fleeces than those from other sheep.
The discovery of the sheep on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula two years ago raised hopes of using breeding to end the need for mulesing and crutching.
Professor Phil Hynd from the University of Adelaide says a study of the sheep has also found that the trait can be bred into commercial flocks.
"Bare sheep don't produce less wool, they actually produce more wool," he said.

Goat abattoir back to full production
The nation's largest goat abattoir has returned to full production today, two days after telling 140 workers they would be laid off temporarily.

Rainfall figures recover in most areas
Although some parts of south-east Queensland are still very dry, the National Climate Centre says the rest of the country has done well out of recent rainfall.
The centre's latest drought statement shows rainfall figures have recovered in most areas over the past year, with isolated dry patches in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales.
Climatologist Blair Trewin says charting rainfall patterns over three to 12 month periods can be helpful.
"Really the time scales that drought matters on depends on what you're trying to do," he said.

Rice farmers back in production
After years of low water allocations and tough growing conditions, rice farmers in southern New South Wales are relieved to be back on their harvesters this month.
During the drought, many farmers thought they had grown their last crop but with growing demand for rice, more growers are returning to the crop.
Rice grower Tim McKindley, at Caldwell near Deniliquin, says providing there is enough water around, rice has a good future.

High prices revive southern Qld fruit and veg industry
A major fruit and vegetable growing district in Queensland is celebrating some of its best produce prices in decades.
Hot summer conditions saw a drop in production on the Granite Belt in the state's south, forcing prices to triple in some cases.
Stanthorpe capsicum grower Cameron Gow says the high prices have revived the local industry.

Citrus growers export returns tipped to fall
Australia's citrus growers will be able export more fruit to the United States this year but returns are tipped to fall.
A larger navel crop is expected this season and 1.9 million cartons of oranges are expected to be exported.
Stuart Monaghan from DNE World Fruit Sales, which imports Australian citrus into the US, says growers will have to accept lower prices to sell the fruit and compete with South Africa.
"We've got to get retail prices in the US down to where consumers will start buying them right away rather than starting off at higher prices," he said.

Local customers remain priority for WA banana growers
Western Australian banana growers continue to face pressure to send fruit to the eastern states.
Two and a half weeks ago, fruit from Carnarvon was raised as a solution to an impending nation-wide banana shortage in the wake of cyclone Larry in Queensland.
But agent John Mercer met growers in Carnarvon last night and he says while the pressure from the east is intense, Perth markets still remain a top priority.
"We're now two and a half weeks wiser then we where before. Certainly the overwhelming thing that came out of the meeting last night is that we want to supply WA customers first," he said.
"If per chance the demand from the eastern states gets greater than that, there's a possibility we may send some fruit east. My guess is long term we'll send a little bit of fruit over there."
Meanwhile the Federal Government has promised to review assistance given to cyclone-affected farmers in north Queensland if necessary.
Banana growers have criticised the Government's $200 a week wage subsidy to keep workers on farms.

Grazier borrows boat to help save flooded cattle
A western Queensland grazier says he has had to use a boat to save cattle from floodwaters on his property.
Heavy recent rain has dumped 150 millimetres on the town of Aramac in the past 48 hours, leading to record flooding in places.
Andrew Cowper from Merino Downs says he had to borrow his neighbour's boat to get to his cattleyards and stop weaner cattle from straying into the fast running water.
"I was worried we'd lose them if they'd got swept out of the smaller creek into the main Belltopper creek," he said.

AWB rejects wheat export system plan
AWB has rejected a new plan to overhaul the wheat export system and says it is wrong to make changes based on assumptions the industry is in crisis.
The plan, unveiled by the Grains Council, would remove AWB's power to block other companies exporting wheat and increase shipments from AWB's rivals.
Attacking the plan, AWB chairman Brendan Stewart told Grains Week delegates, the industry was not in crisis because of the Iraq kickbacks scandal.
"What I see at the moment is a debate that's being done is a vacuum and debate that's being done in a self-induced crisis mode which I have to say is not there," he said.
The discussion paper suggests AWB could lose the single desk in 2010, while a new body called Australian Wheat Associates would take over the company's veto powers.
But AWB's Ian Donges told delegates is was dangerous to base Australia Wheat Associates on industry companies like Meat and Livestock Australia.
"I wouldn't use that as a model that necessarily is going to deliver a better outcome just because it is a model. There are other ways of doing it," he said.
Mr Donges also says the timelines to implement the plan where unlikely to be achieved.
The discussion paper has also been criticised by growers and AWB's rivals.
The New South Wales Farmers Association says it will not support any plan which increases exports through companies other than AWB.
There was also an attempt from one grower to call a no-confidence motion in the Grains Council.
The Grain Exporters Association's Alick Osborne says while the plan provides for increased export competition, it does not go far enough.
"This may go some way to sharpening that process up if there are other exporters that can access particular markets and can post their bids," he said.

CBH profit drops
WA grain handler and marketer Co-operative Bulk Handling (CBH) has reported a net after-tax profit of $61.4 million.
That is down $40 million, as a result of a 3 million tonne drop in last season's grain harvest.

Residents warned as river continues to rise
Police are warning the residents of Katherine in the Northern Territory to be prepared to evacuate as the Katherine River continues to rise.
The Katherine River has grown into a mighty brown fast flowing flood today, a flood that has already broken its banks outside of town and is now scant centimetres from doing the same in Katherine itself.
While police are hoping the river will peak shortly at 18.89 metres, there is the continued possibility the river will continue to rise and authorities are warning residents to pack up the essentials and be prepared to hear the evacuations sirens.

Abattoir expected to confirm sackings withdrawn
The Cowra abattoir is today expected to confirm it is withdrawing termination notices for 29 workers.
The decision to sack the employees and offer lower paid contracts became a major test of the Federal Government's new industrial relations laws.
One of the affected workers, Rodney Veney, says he is thankful for the national attention on the Cowra abattoir because it helped save his job.
"Cowra's only a pin dot on the map and to get all this attention I think management might have been a bit shocked about it," he said.
"As I said, they've taken the termination notice back but if I didn't have the job at the abattoir I'm in a bit of a difficult position.

Rural doctors want funding for more psychologists
Rural doctors say new funding for mental health services must take into account the lack of psychologists in regional Australia.
The Federal Government will spend $1.8 billion increasing psychology services and introducing new programs for young people to cope with depression.
Dr Ross Maxwell, president of the Rural Doctors Association, believes a plan to employ mental health nurses in medical clinics is a good approach for country areas.
"I think it has the potential, if well managed and well delivered, to make a difference," he said.
"I think the initiatives around employing mental health nurses in psychiatrists and general practice rooms, I think that is a very interesting and innovative way forward.

Exporters can protect themselves against interest rate rise: strategist
Talk in the financial markets this week is not good news for farmers or the resource sector.
Markets are abuzz with speculation that interest rates could soon rise for the first time in more than 12 months.
The forecast has led currency market speculators to buy the Aussie dollar, pushing it up by one US cent in one day.
Interest rate strategist with Macquarie Bank Rory Robertson says any rate rise would be small and exporters can protect themselves.
"Australia's got this once in a generation commodity price boom going which would tend to produce upward pressure on the Aussie dollar," he said.
"Yet the Australian dollar last week was hovering around its post float average and most economists would say that is a bit bizarre.

Farm succession debate under way in Dubbo
The difficult issue of handing the farm over is being debated at the first national conference on farm succession this week at Dubbo, in New South Wales.
There is a growing recognition that few individual professionals, like accountants, counsellors and consultants have all the skills to help farm families through the succession process.
Victorian accountant Peter Nelson says the conference has helped him realise the benefits of obtaining other specialist advice to help his clients.
"Most definitely and there are people who do these sorts of things, you know they're more trained and suited to the project. We just need to resource them and bring them into our system," he said.

Cattle sale under way in freezing conditions
Cattle buyers from across Australia are braving freezing conditions in Bothwell in Tasmania, where 5,500 weaners are going under the hammer.
It is the largest single cattle sale in southern Australia, with buyers from South Australia and New South Wales.
Chris Taylor from Roberts Limited says prices are expected to be high but that will not deter interstate buyers.
"The mainlanders that have come to this sale over the years have been happy to pay what's considered as a premium price," he said.

New strains of stem rust disease found in SA
South Australia could be facing one of its worst cropping seasons for the fungal disease stem rust.
New strains of the disease have been found in wheat plants from across the Eyre Peninsula and the southern half of the Yorke Peninsula.
Hugh Wallwork of the South Australian Research and Development Institute says wet conditions over summer helped the disease to thrive.
"I think it would be the most that I have come across in the last 20 years," he said.

Blue gum woodchip shipment set for Japan
The first shipment of plantation blue gum woodchips from western Victoria and south-eastern South Australia is being loaded at Portland.
The 21,000 tonne load will head for pulp and paper mills in Japan tomorrow and eventually half a million tonnes will be sourced locally each year.
Nick Kingsford from Mitsui Afforestation Limited says this first load is a significant milestone for the industry.
"It's the first commercial shipment and there's a significant resource out there and from here exports are just going to continue to grow," he said.

Indonesian islands focus of rural development workshop
Agroforestry could be a major step towards food security across Nusa Tengarra Timur.
The islands, in eastern Indonesia, are the focus of an international rural development workshop in Kupang this week.
Small remote rural villages relying on subsistence agriculture providing for their daily food requirements have developed stands of mahogany, sandlewood, teak and cashews.
There are also small pockets of original forest vegetation within the broader tropical savannah grasslands.
But it has been agreed that non-timber forestry products such as honey, dyes, medicines and fruits could be further developed to generate income.

Exporters concerned about Indonesian ban
Horticultural exporters say Indonesia has effectively banned imports of table grapes and other Australian produce, in retaliation for the Papuan asylum seeker affair.
Table grape shipments were stopped indefinitely yesterday afternoon after the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service received notification from Indonesia of a new export protocol, which exporters say is unworkable.
Indonesia is Australia's second biggest table grape market, worth more than $50 million.
Brian Ceresa from exporter John Holman and Company says he is in little doubt what has caused action from Indonesia.
"My personal suspicions are simply a knee-jerk reaction coming from the Indonesian Government over the refugee status of the West Papuan situation which has been well publicised over the last seven days," he said.
AQIS says it is trying to get to obtain more information about the export protocol, but believes it's likely to affect all countries, not just Australia.
Trade Minister Mark Vaile says he is now investigating the situation in Indonesia, but has not received any notification of an official ban on horticultural produce.
He say he will not consider compensation for exporters who might experience delays until more in known.
"I mean it's happened in the past and we'll have a look at the issue on its merits if that eventuates," he said.

US senator seeks US action against AWB
A key US senator claims the Bush administration has sided with Australia instead of American wheat growers in the oil-for-food scandal, and will use the allegation to press for US action.
Just days after asking the Bush administration to probe whether the AWB violated US laws or WTO trade rules, top Senate Agriculture Committee Democrat Tom Harkin has cited US cables first disclosed in the Cole investigation.
"We've now discovered that the Bush administration advised the Australian Government on how to handle the Australian Wheat Board's growing public problems about its dealings in Iraq," he said.
"This is very troubling. It appears the administration, outright dismissed any credibility to the Australian Wheat Board's contributing to the Hussein regime, under the UN's oil for food program."

US farm payments tipped to fall
Domestic farm payments in the United States are likely to fall under a new farm bill to be introduced next year.
The US has offered to reduce tariffs and subsidies as part of the Doha world trade talks, but will need to reform its domestic policies first.
Visiting Australia, senior economist with the US Department of Agriculture, Carole Goodloe says average farm incomes are well above other sectors, and government assistance is harder to justify.
"Just about all the major players are saying it's time for some reform," she said.

Key US retailers back wool campaign
Two key US retailers have backed the wool industry's multi-million dollar test marketing campaign to get American shoppers to buy more wool.
Three bodies are funding the campaign, including Australian Wool Innovation, promotional body Woolmark, and the International Wool Textile Organisation.
Head of Woolmark Brenda Mcgahan says the campaign, to be launched in September, is also trying to boost the price of wool for growers and manufacturers.
"It is a major issue for our growers and also for the international wool pipeline," she said.
"A consumer can't buy wool if the retailer doesn't stock it, and a retailer isn't going to stock wool if they don't think consumers are going to buy it.
"We'll be working with their buying teams and their sales associates, because why would a consumer pay a premium for something if they don't understand the benefits and a good sales man or woman needs to be able to explain to a consumer why you're going to pay more for a product."
Those two US retailers have not yet been named.
Australian Wool Innovation has appointed Dr John Keniry to chair its 2006 WoolPoll Panel.
Dr Keniry led the review in the live animal export trade in 2003.
The poll of woolgrowers is held every three years, to set the level of the wool tax.
The wool market slipped again at auctions this week, with the eastern market indicator dropping off eight cents, to 728 cents a kilogram clean.
Landmark agent Rodney Peglar, says while a seasonal record was paid for a superfine bale from northern region, the broader wools performed particularly poorly.
"It's two markets, there are the good wools and unfortunately due to seasonal conditions the buyers are having tremendous trouble being able to find enough wool to make batches up that are sound, or of the right quality," he said.

River level steady in Katherine
The river is steady, and the water very slowly draining away from the streets of Katherine in the Northern Territory.
The Stuart Highway south of Katherine has now re-opened to light vehicles, although the central part of the town remains flooded. Traffic north to Katherine is restricted to essential vehicles, and the road north to Darwin is still impassable.

Weather keeps WA forecasters busy
Life in Western Australia's north-west has never been busier for staff at the Bureau of Meteorology at Port Hedland.
Category two Cyclone Hubert is expected to cross the Pilbara coast late tonight.
It is the seventh cyclone to affect the region this year and forecaster Gavin Edmonds is quickly becoming a household name across the north west.
"It's been very busy hasn't it this season and a lot of people utilise, I suppose my service," he said.
"I've got both phones sometimes attached to both ears and there's obviously people queued up on the end of those.

Bird flu confirmed in UK
The deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu has been confirmed in the UK for the first time.
Tests on a wild swan in Scotland have confirmed the disease.
The Scottish Government has set up a surveillance zone and banned the movement of birds in or out of the area.
Germany has also reported its first case of bird flu in commerical poultry, and in Africa, H5N1 has reached the continent's largest city of Lagos, in Nigeria.
Meanwhile, the latest quarantine surveys in East Timor show there is still no sign of avian influenza.
Four major initiatives are underway to increase the chances of early detection, and to help the East Timorese prepare for the disease.
Dr Emma Watkins says improved public awareness, rapid disease testing and helping plan scarce resources are key points.
"Effective surveillance really relies on being able to investigate disease as it comes along," she said.
So the capacity of the local animal health authorities to do that, is really important. So we have undertaken a continuous effort to increase the capacity to locally diagnose this disease.

Researchers aiming for safe Q-fever vaccine
Scientists at James Cook University in Queensland are working to develop an alternative vaccine for Q-fever, which will not produce debilitating side effects.
Q-fever is a highly infectious disease usually caught after contact with affected animals, which causes flu-like symptoms and can be fatal.
The university's Ray Layton says the new vaccine will be developed over the next six to eight months.
"In fact it's one of the only vaccines out there at the moment where you need to be screened before you're vaccinated to make sure you can actually be vaccinated without too many adverse affects and that probably stems I think from the fact that they culture this organism in chicken eggs, and a lot of people have adverse reactions to those egg yolk antigens," he said.

Cattle sales strong
Arctic conditions at the Bothwell calf sale in Tasmania yesterday did not deter cattle buyers from around Australia.
Nearly 6,000 calves were auctioned for around $3 million.
The top price for the day of $880 a head went to Ellendale graziers Greg and Tania Downham for their Hereford-Charolais steers.
Many of the calves will be shipped to Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales.
Greg Downham says prices were up on last year and the calves were in excellent condition.
"We've had an exceptional season, the best that we can remember for a long time, the spring and summer have just been something out of the box," he said.

US abuzz about Aussie bees
Bee hives are being stolen from almond orchards in the United States, leading to a rapid growth in imports from Australia.
The bees are vital to pollinate the country's rapidly growing almond industry.
Barry Pobke from the South Australian Apiarist Association, says thousands of kilograms of bees could be exported every year.

Wet causes havoc in north-west Qld
Life saving carnivals usually have a fair bit to do with water, but in north-west Queensland too much water has forced the cancellation of an annual fund-raiser for the Royal Flying Doctor service.
Heavy rain around Kynuna, between Winton and Cloncurry, has flooded properties cut the Landsborough Highway, leaving dozens of travellers stranded.
The cook at the local Blue Heeler Hotel Matthew 'cookie' Messina says the big wet is causing havoc.

Flooding delays Asian live cattle exports
Flooding across the Top End has created major delays in live cattle exports to Asia.
Ships bound for Indonesia are expected to remain anchored in the Port of Darwin until after Easter and the market is expected to swing towards available slaughter cattle.
Steve Ellison from the Northern Territory Live Exporters Association says at least 9,000 cattle are stranded.
"Due to the wet weather at this stage they are having trouble getting them out," he said.
"It will certainly affect saleyard numbers and obviously the movement of cattle wherever.
"The roads are closed, stock camps have got to be able to work to put the cattle in the yards even if the yards were open. So it's a double whammy really.
"[But] the condition of the cattle is excellent, but no it looks like being a boomer season. We'll get the numbers, it's just a case of you have got to be patient."
Meanwhile the Territory's third biggest town is in recovery mode after last week's flood.
Businesses in Katherine have resumed trading, residents have returned home to assess the damage and the Health Department will begin mosquito spraying today.
Local mango grower Peter Marks says the water is falling away quickly and he does not think the flood will delay this year's flowering.
"Another grower spoke to me the other day and he's got one block on the river," he said.
"He's got a house there and the house is high and dry but he said the water was flowing through the trees, not that deep but he didn't see any great concern with it.
"In fact we find if we have a big wet, we have some sections of the paddock that stay quite wet and they always flower the earliest.
"So they're a weird creature, where none of us have got them worked out too good yet. Pretty amazing."
North-west of Katherine, residents across the Daly River region are preparing for major flooding within the next two days.
A king tide near the mouth of the Daly River mid-week is also expected to have an impact.

Official aims to settle trade dispute with Indonesia
Efforts are under way to rescue Australia's $35 million horticulture trade with Indonesia.
Exports of grapes, citrus, apples and pears are effectively suspended after the Indonesian Government imposed surprise new export protocols.
Australian quarantine officials stopped issuing permits for Indonesia on Thursday, although a shipment of grapes worth nearly a million dollars was already at sea and is in danger of being rejected.
David Minus from the Australian Horticultural Exporters Association says a federal trade official has been dispatched to Indonesia to try to settle the dispute.
"Australia is fighting for its horticultural survival and we need every market we can hang on to," he said.
"Indonesia is after all a big market, it's not the wealthiest but it's a very big market and it's right on our doorstep.
"We're ideally placed to serve it with temperate fruit and sub-tropical citrus that they have difficulty growing in Indonesia."
Table grape growers hope the quarantine dispute can be resolved quickly.
Australian Table Grape Association president Nick Muraca says despite initial fears, the political dispute over asylum seekers from Papua does not appear to have caused the problem.
"I don't believe that to be the case nor do we have any reason to believe that that is the case," he said.

PM to give statement to AWB inquiry
Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile is about to step into the witness box at the oil-for-food inquiry in Sydney.
His appearance comes as the Prime Minister, John Howard, confirmed he has been called on to provide a sworn statement to the inquiry.
Senior counsel assisting the inquiry John Agius told a packed hearing room, the Prime Minister will supply by 4pm tomorrow his confidential statement documenting when he first learned of irregular payments by AWB to the Iraqi regime.
This afternoon, Mr Vaile's examination will explore what and when the Trade Minister knew about money paid to the Iraqi Grains Board, the Jordanian trucking company Alia and secret cables advising of complaints by the US Wheat Associates about Australia's inflated wheat contracts with Iraq.

Drought relief funding increase raises questions
The Productivity Commission says the Federal Government's 100 per cent increase in drought relief funding may need investigation.
Drought relief is set to top $600 million in 2005/06 and receives special mentions in the commission's annual review of government expenditure.
Chairman Gary Banks says the commission is not questioning the need for assistance but says any single item costing more than half a billion dollars could spark calls for a review.
"There is always a questions about that," he said.
"We never know whether we have got the model exactly right in any area of industry support.
"Clearly drought assistance is extremely important and you wouldn't want to make any changes without very careful examination of all the issues.

Flooding continues in western Qld
Flooding is continuing to cause problems in Queensland.
Heavy rain in the state's central mid-west last week has cut roads around Longreach but flooding in the Thomson River is expected to be a boon for graziers.
Moderate flooding is now expected to extend downstream to Jundah.
Further north, the barramundi are biting after the floodwaters and Arthur McDouall almost landed one in the main street of Normanton.
"Threw a line in down there for a while virtually at the end of the main street, had a barra on there almost straightaway, got him to the edge of the bank and he jumped off the hook but you get in the right place at the right time they get some good catches when the floods are on," he said.

Merger set to create third largest Aust agribusiness
The stage is set for the formation of Australia's third largest agribusiness behind Elders and Landmark.
The majority of shareholders in New South Wales based Ruralco have agreed to a merger with Tasmanian company, Roberts Limited.
Ruralco chairman Richard England says the two companies will combine their wool, livestock, real estate and rural merchandising businesses.
Mr England expects the board of Roberts to endorse the offer at a meeting today.
"The offer is five Ruralco shares for every eight Roberts shares," he said.
"The merged group will have a market capitalisation in excess of $160 million.

Tomato producer calls for eradication of new plant virus
Australia's chief plant health officers will try to control rather than eradicate a new tomato virus in Queensland.
Yellow leaf curl virus has been confirmed for the first time in Australia at farms on the outskirts of Brisbane.
It is carried by silver leaf whitefly and quarantine measures are expected to be announced this week.
James Head from Queensland's largest tomato producer, SP Exports, says an eradication program would have been better.
"I'd say control is probably the easier option to take," he said.
"Whether or not the effects will be what's desired for the outcome, whether control would be better than eradication, I'd say eradication would sound the better idea.

Dairy farmers win milk price rise
Western Australian dairy farmers have won another price rise for their milk.
Fonterra lifted prices one and a half centres a litre last month but farmers said that was not enough.
The company will pay another half a centre per litre to milk suppliers to its WA-based subsidiary Peters and Brownes.

Sheep shearing via phone may ring true in the future
Shearing sheep in the future could be as easy as dialling a number on your mobile phone.
Researchers at the University of South Australia are looking for a bioactive substance which would cause wool fibres to break simultaneously at a predetermined time.
The new method of alternative shearing is still a few years away but researcher Michelle Hebard says the possibilities are endless.
"The animals would receive an implant, this may be in the ear at tagging time," she said.
"That implant would contain a bioactive which would be activated through the mobile.

Country meets city at Royal Easter Show
The country has come to the big smoke for the Sydney Royal Easter Show - Australia's biggest.
The Royal Easter Show is an event on an amazing scale - 15,000 animals competing for over half a million dollars in prizemoney over the two weeks and 900,00 people are expected to come to watch them do it.

Good turnout for district fundraiser
Around 200 people turned up in the tiny WA town of Yuna for the district's biggest fundraiser at the weekend.
The Whelarra Regatta started around five years ago and involves small teams rowing handmade rafts across a 170 metre dam.
People crowded the banks to see the teams race.
Carisa Grylls of Chapman Valley was in the UDL team and says it was a great day to show off the community.
"Well we didn't really think that we were going to win the race, so we kind of thought that we'll head towards the bar," she said.

US corners Iraqi wheat market
As the oil-for-food inquiry drags on, new figures show US wheat exports to Iraq over the past year have grown almost five-fold.
The US exported about 500,000 metric tones of wheat to Iraq last marketing year before the UN Volker report on alleged AWB kickbacks to Iraq led to a cut-off of AWB shipments and a surge in US exports.
"For the past year, we've captured almost three-quarters of the Iraqi wheat market, which is quite large, which is well over 3 million tonnes and we've gained a very large share of the Iraqi rice market," Bob Riemenschneider, grain and feed director at the US Foreign Agricultural Services, said.
The US has exported about 2.4 million tonnes of wheat to Iraq so far this marketing year and Mr Riemenschneider expects that to increase gradually in coming years.
Meanwhile the US is ramping up pressure on Australia's single desk for wheat exports, as Federal Government ministers begin appearing before the Cole inquiry.
Key member of the US Agricultural Committee Senator Tom Harkin says Australia agreed to rein-in trading monopolies in its free trade agreement and the single desk goes against world trade rules.
Spokesman for Senator Harkin, Dave Townsend, says the US is ready to respond to the Cole inquiry's recommendations.
"Keep in mind this is in the context of the WTO negotiations and I think it's fair to say that everyone is looking to have more transparent and open market through any reform in the WTO and having a monopoly in charge of wheat exports prevents that from happening," he said.

US dry spell looks positive for Aust wheat growers
A continuing dry spell in the United States is looking positive for wheat growers here in Australia.
Monthly supply and demand estimates were released by the United States Department of Agriculture overnight and are largely unchanged.
But national pool manager for AWB Limited David Johnson says the dry conditions are expected to have an impact on America's hard red winter wheat crop, which is in direct competition with Australia.
"We've already seen downgrades in their production forecasts in Texas and Oklahoma in the southern states," he said.

Govt knew of new Indonesian fruit and veg protocols
The Federal Government says it has known for almost a year that Indonesia was planning new import protocols for Australian fruit and vegetables.
The conditions were imposed last week and growers say the $35 million export trade is effectively at a standstill.
The Federal Government believes Indonesia put in the protocols aimed at protecting it from fruit fly after receiving an infected fruit shipment from another country.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says Australia lodged submissions on the protocols last year but did not hear back from Indonesia until the conditions were imposed on April 4.
"Indonesia did not respond to the submission of Australia and the various other countries before deciding on a new decree," he said.

Centre to make sure biosecurity experts up to the job
Making sure the experts are up to scratch will be one of the tasks of a new biosecurity risk analysis centre in Victoria.
The Federal Government has commissioned the University of Melbourne to investigate how Australia assesses biosecurity threats and whether it is being done well enough.
Professor Mark Burgman says part of his job is working out the best way to keep Australia free of diseases like foot and mouth or bird flu.
"Initially our focus is biosecurity and we will develop tools to help people do that job better," he said.

US beef processor banned from exporting to Hong Kong
US meat exports to Asia have been dealt another blow, with a major processor banned from exporting beef to Hong Kong.
A shipment of Cargill beef was found to contain fragments of bone in contravention of export regulations designed to prevent the spread of mad cow disease.
Chief market analyst at Meat and Livestock Australia Peter Weeks says the news will not affect Japan but the latest controversy could delay the resumption of US exports to Korea.
"But outside of Hong Kong is far more significant particularly in Korea where they have linked their reopening, the timing of their reopening to instances, to the previous instance as well as the third BSE case in the US and the circumstances surrounding that," he said.

Brazil beef exports no threat to Australian markets: producer
There are claims today that Australia will not have to compete with the world's biggest beef exporting country in our key markets for at least a decade.
Beef producer Chris Ward has been working in Brazil for 20 years and says the country is struggling to increase its 174 million head herd due to a poor currency, lack of infrastructure and low commodity prices.
Mr Ward says the major inhibitor is the presence of foot and mouth disease, which will continue to lock Brazil out of Australia's major markets of Japan, Korea and the US.
"In terms of competing with Australia in the premium market that Australia plays in, I don't see that," he said.

Resources industry staffing problems expected to worsen
Finding and retaining staff is one of the biggest issues facing Australia's booming resources industry, according to a new study.
The People at Work report, published by the Chamber of Minerals and Energy, says the issue is only going to get worse.
Author Bernard Salt says the problem in hanging onto staff has a lot to do with different values between the generations.
"We have always assumed that we're the best country in the world and everyone will automatically want to come to Australia to work," he said.

Pastoralists expect to double cattle production
Northern Territory pastoralists expect to increase cattle production by 50 per cent within the next 10 years, according to the first comprehensive survey since the early 1980s.
Better fencing and water points in central Australia, and improved pasture in the north would result in the increased carrying capacity
Pastoral extension officer Trudi Oxley says improved weaning rates also mean more production.
"We came up with a weaning percentage across the NT as being 71 per cent, so for every hundred cows there were 71 weaners pulled off them when they were mustered and a mortality rate around 3 per cent," she said.

Leather business suffers from impact of drought, cyclone
A leather tanning business in south-east Queensland has been dealt a double blow.
Murgon Leather has been forced to impose water restrictions due to the drought, while its main supplier of hides closed in the wake of cyclone Larry.
The Innisfail Meatworks will remain shut until the end of the month.
General manager James Barbeler says the leather tanning business has been forced to cut back on staff and production.

Sheep's temperament has impact on reproductive rate
'Crazy' sheep are more than just a nuisance in the yards - research has found they are are also less fertile and less productive.
Dr Alex Ball of Sheep Genetics Australia is looking at the impact of temperament in trials on his property at Armidale in New South Wales and elsewhere across Australia.
He says a nervous temperament can have an impact on how well sheep reproduce.
"We have just been basically tagging animals be they crazy or calm and what it has had is impacts on reproductive rate," he said.
"So we know our own crazy ewes they are probably rearing 20 to 30 per cent less lambs and that's mirrored by some very good research in Western Australia.

Victorian takes out young auctioneers award
A 24-year-old Victorian auctioneer has won the National Young Auctioneers Championship.
Adam Mountjoy from Mansfield in Victoria's Alpine region received the highest score after being judged on diction, presentation and manner during a sale of four steers at the Sydney Royal Easter Show.
He says it is very rewarding after working so hard to prepare for the competition.
"Just going through previous videos and competitions that have been held and I guess analysing and picking out the good points and some of the better things to do or try, and do on the day," he said.

Farming grants to aid environmental projects
The Federal Government wants to give farmers cash incentives to encourage them to carry out environmental improvements on their land.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has set a deadline of 2008 to implement the scheme, which he says will improve the environment and lift farm productivity.
Mr McGauran will not say how much the plan will cost but says the National Farmers Federation's call for a billion dollars in compensation is well off the mark.
"No where near in the ball park but before we lock ourselves into positions why don't we find a way forward," he said.
"We'll fund some pilot projects and I'm glad to say the states are showing some interest and a number are showing strong support.
"If we work cooperatively we'll find a way to strike the balance between conservation or environment and production."
The NFF has welcomed the announcement, and says the scheme should not be viewed as a cash handout or production subsidy.
President Peter Corish says farmers manage 60 per cent of Australia's land and deserve to be rewarded for their environmental works.
"Farmers are asked to manage that native vegetation at their own cost and we believe firmly if the community wants to maintain that native vegetation, certainly that farmer should be rewarded for managing that," he said.

Court postpones decision on AWB 'apology' document
A decision on whether AWB's so-called 'apology' document should be made public has been postponed until late April.
This morning the Federal Court ruled it would allow further evidence from AWB supporting its claim of legal professional privilege.
The document was initially provided to the Cole inquiry along with other evidence prepared by AWB company secretary Dr Richard Fuller.
A draft apology, it was written by former managing director Andrew Lindberg, after a US-based public relations specialist advised AWB to over-apologise, to try to counter any corporate scandal relating to the oil-for-food program.
At this morning's hearing, the Federal Court heard AWB would provide a second witness statement testifying the apology was prepared as part of lawyer-client meetings and as such should remain confidential.
AWB also questioned the power of Commissioner Terence Cole to make any rulings around lawyer-client confidentiality, an issue disputed by lawyers acting on behalf of the commission.
A full hearing has been adjourned until April 24.
Meanwhile another two senior staff members have resigned from AWB.

Yellow leaf curl virus outbreak hits tomato growing region
There has been a confirmed outbreak of the tomato yellow leaf curl virus in one of Australia's major tomato growing regions.
Plant biosecurity officers are in Bundaberg in south-east Queensland to increase surveillance and identify the spread of the virus, discovered in a backyard garden.
The disease was only recently detected in Australia, near Brisbane and can stunt plant growth and slash production.
Hydroponic grower David Da Tra says growers need to keep the virus carrier at bay.
"Just hoping we can control or minimise the vector which is the silverleaf greenhouse," he said.

Horticulture industry suppliers on notice to cut costs
Suppliers of materials, machinery and other goods to the horticulture sector have been placed on notice to cut costs to growers.
Fruit and vegetable growers have launched a class action against cardboard box maker, Amcor, seeking up to $300 million compensation over alleged price fixing on packaging.
They claim 17,000 growers and some major food manufacturers were overcharged more than $700 million for boxes and pallets.
Mike Badcock from grower group Ausveg says growers are now looking at costs across the sector.
"It seems quite suspicious doesn't it. America, the fuel price is only half what we pay in Australia, to put a pivot irrigator up in America, it costs you between a third and half what it costs to put one up in Australia, fertiliser is a lot cheaper in new Zealand," he said.
"We've really got to get to the bottom of a lot of these things in Australia and find out why it's costing us more to farm in Australia."
Despite claims farmers are losing bargaining power, a new report says selling produce under contract does not place growers at the mercy of big business.
The report, commissioned by the Australian Farm Institute, says there has been substantial growth in the level of farm produce sold on the contract system and prices are not necessarily falling.
Report author Mark Barber says it depends on the farmer.
"It opens up all sorts of new opportunities and some farmers will benefit more than others from this," he said.

Riverland citrus growers locked out of Indonesian trade
Citrus growers in South Australia's Riverland have been locked out of selling fruit to Indonesia despite being free of fruit fly.
Australia's $35 million fruit and vegetable trade with Indonesia is at a standstill because of new import protocols designed to address fruit fly concerns.
The Riverland's fruit fly-free status is recognised by other Asian markets like Japan and Taiwan but not by Indonesia's newly imposed quarantine protocols.
Judith Damiani from Australian Citrus Growers says it is an important market.
"It's not one of our largest markets in terms of volume or value but we do send quite a significant amount of mandarins and valencias as well," she said.

Dairy Farmers restructure goes ahead despite profit
Despite posting a half-year profit of $4.7 million, the Dairy Farmers Co-operative will push on with a restructure involving the closure of four plants.
The Bomaderry factory, in the south-east of New South Wales, shuts down today, while the Toowoomba plant, in southern Queensland, will close by the end of this month with the loss of 12 full and part-time jobs.
Chief executive Rob Gordon says changes across the business are expected to save $42 million a year.

Locusts swarm across WA wheatbelt
Locust plagues are emerging as a big concern for winter crops in Western Australia this season.
Locusts have made their way from the wet pastoral regions into agricultural areas, with farmers now reporting locusts swarms across the wheatbelt.
Senior entomologist with the Department of Agriculture Kevin Walden says the green feed in the agricultural regions could help locusts survive for weeks.
"We're likely to see these locusts surviving into May but by the time the females are completing their cycle, then numbers will drop off very quickly," he said.
"But, as I said, if the break of the season's early, then there may be a bit of an overlap between crops emerging and locusts still flying around.

Arid zone research group research to focus on desert areas
Pastoralists and researchers from around the country have taken the first step towards creating a new arid zone research group.
The group will work independently of state and territory organisations, focusing on problems that affect pastoral production in all desert areas.
Mark Ashley from the 21st Century Pastoral Program says initial research will focus on reducing input costs and improving technology for the wool and beef industries.
"As it stands at the moment most of the state agencies are focused with their particular industry," he said.
"A lot of these issues are big issues, they go across state boundaries.

Weather blamed for hike in fish prices
Fish prices in Melbourne have jumped by up to 20 per cent in the lead-up to Easter.
An unusually high number of low pressure systems with high winds have kept many small fishing boats off the water.
Ross McGowan from Seafood Industry Victoria says the smaller boats catch most of the fish bought by restaurants and which are also popular at Easter.
"They generally catch the fish that end up in restaurants and the Victoria market for example," he said.
"Whiting, flathead, mullet, the whole range of snapper of course.
"They're the sorts of fish the bay and inlet fishermen catch, including calamari.

Pasture shortage limits cattle feedlot expansion
A shortage of pasture in some provinces of Indonesia is limiting the expansion of small community cattle feedlots.
Rather than feed grain, villagers rely on leucaena, legumes, kapok and even banana stems and leaves.
It can take up to 12 months to fatten cattle in this way for the lucrative Jakarta market.
Researcher Maximilian Kapa says one feedlot can support up to 15 remote families in West Timor.
"It is a very good market, especially the Jakarta market," he said.
"Actually the farmers here cannot fulfil the market demand because there is a trend that the population of Bali cattle declines here every year due to uncontrolled breeding and minimised management like that.

I didn't see rorts cables: Howard
Prime Minister John Howard has told the Cole inquiry he does not believe he received or read any cables that warned AWB was involved in sanctions-busting.
Mr Howard was under tight security when he arrived at the commission to explain when he first knew about AWB's improper payments to the Iraqi regime.
Blocked-off streets, bag searches and sniffer dogs greeted those who entered court two on level five of the building ahead of the Prime Minister's long-awaited appearance at the Cole inquiry.
The Prime Minister spent a brisk 42 minutes in the witness box.
When senior counsel assisting, John Agius, asked him to put a date on his knowledge that the Iraqis were rorting the oil-for-food program, Mr Howard said it was probably a year before a speech he gave on Iraq to the National Press Club in March, 2003.
When asked if he knew AWB was involved in that rorting, Mr Howard replied: "No, I didn't. I had always believed the best of that company. It would never have crossed my mind it would have behaved corruptly."
Commissioner Cole refused any cross-examination of the Prime Minister, saying it was outside the terms of reference. 

Petition
Meanwhile a petition supported by some of the leading lights in the legal profession is calling for a widening of the inquiry's terms of reference.
Lawyers, barristers and academics from the University of New South Wales say AWB and the Federal Government may have violated international law by allowing bribes to be paid to Saddam Hussein.
Petition leader Ben Sawell says it is now clear the powers of the Cole inquiry are too narrow.
"There is a great deal of concern in the legal profession about the conduct of the Australian Government in all of this business of the oil-for-food scandal," he said.

Wine grapes dumped as oversupply woes hit growers
Tens of thousands of tonnes of Riverland wine grapes will be dumped on the ground or left to rot on the vine this season because of the national oversupply.
The South Australian growers have been left with no market for their fruit after some had contracts suspended, while others were not able to renew their agreements with wineries.
The region's lost income could total $65 million.
Loxton grower Glenn Arnold says the situation is desperate.
"We're just trying to survive," he said.
"Everybody says there's swings and roundabout and you know good times are followed by bad times, bad times are usually followed by good times ... we've just got to hang in there.

WA wine producer secures large UK contract
Palandri wines of Margaret River in Western Australia has just secured the state's single largest export ever into the United Kingdom.
Eighty thousand cases will go to 1,800 British supermarkets.
Palandri's Gordon Grant says WA is being recognised as producing a unique, quality wine for under $24.
He says the contract is significant for bulk producers of generic wines.
"It's really starting to gain ground, the buyers in particular are staring to see Western Australia as something very different to the other material they have got on their shelves," he said.

Farmers environmental grant 'pork barrelling'
The Federal Government's plan to pay farmers to better manage the land has been labelled a "veiled production subsidy" and a "pork barrel" by a Canberra think tank.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran wants to give farmers cash payments to better protect the land and lift their productivity.
He believes farmers are carrying an unfair share of the costs of managing the environment and should be rewarded for carrying out projects which benefit the entire community.
But the Australia Institute's Andrew Macintosh says the Government has a poor record of delivering environmental projects and in allocating funding to regional areas.
"What we've seen with the Natural Heritage Trust is that the program's turned into a massive pork barrel that's dressed up in green clothing and that's my big fear with this," he said.
Mr McGauran says the program will not become a spending black hole and denies the proposed payments would become production subsidies.

Paying more for early child care an option, says association
Regional Australia is having to think creatively to overcome shortages of childcare places and funding.
Cost and access are still big problems for many farming families who now rely on a second income to make ends meet.
Lynne Wannon, from the National Association of Community-based Childcare Services, says both parents and governments need to consider paying more for early childhood care.
"There are different models around, there are mobile services where they have outreach programs," she said.
"A van will go out into a farm community and children can come there but they might only get one day a fortnight of a program.

Easter gifts may post disease risk: AQIS
The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) is warning that Easter gifts from overseas, such as painted or blown eggs, could spread bird flu to humans and birds.
Carson Creagh from AQIS says the service will seize hundreds of "at risk" items this weekend including eggs, feathers and nests made of dried grapevines, and straw.
He says many come from Eastern Europe or the Mediterranean and could introduce bird flu, Newcastle disease or other viruses capable of devastating Australia's poultry industry.
"The obvious one is avian influenza which can be transmitted on eggs," he said.

Croc captured in Katherine main street
While the floodwaters are subsiding in the Northern Territory, it is taking longer to remove the visiting wildlife.
Last night, a metre-long freshwater crocodile was captured in the main street of Katherine
And at Mataranka Homestead, a hundred kilometres south, Deborah Moore says her place has become an ark.
"There's lots of kangaroos and peacocks and snakes and quite a few crocodiles around as well," she said.

Priority scheme in place for dwindling Q fever vaccine supplies
Meatworkers will be given priority access to the last remaining doses of Q fever vaccine to protect against the debilitating disease that is spread to human through contact with infected feral and domestic livestock.
This year's demand for the vaccine is expected to exceed current supplies, and fresh stocks cannot be produced until a new lab opens early next year.
Dr Rachel David, from CSL Pharmaceuticals, the only company in the world that makes Q Vax, has now set up a scheme to reduce the impact of the looming shortage.
"We've put in place a prioritisation system so that people involved directly in meat processing will be able to contact CSL and get access to the vaccine as a priority," she said.

Abattoirs given green light for halal beef exports to Malaysia
Three Australian abattoirs, one in Queensland and two in Victoria, have been given approval to send halal beef back into the Malaysian market.
Last August, Malaysia suspended beef imports from Australia due to concerns that slaughter methods do not meet Islamic standards.
The general manager of Norvic Foods, Jon Hayes, says approval was received to resume beef exports from the company's Wodonga abattoir after religious and technical auditors inspected the site.
"Malaysia is only taking a very small percentage of the Australian beef and it's another market that Australia needs," he said.
"We can't consume what we produce for 20 million people and we need the total global scene, and Malaysia is a very important market."

Shareholders vote not to rebuild Norply factory
The Kyogle community, on the New South Wales north coast, has had its worst fears confirmed with Norply Timbers deciding not to rebuild its factory after a fire last year.
Up until last September's devastating fire, the Norply factory employed about 140 people, making it one of the most significant employers in a town with a population of 4,000.
There were hopes that the company would eventually rebuild on its existing site but those have now been dashed.
Norply's 30 shareholders met earlier this week, when a majority voted to declare a dividend rather than rebuild the mill.

Little central Aust critter becoming a popular pet
It might not be the Easter bunny but a little critter from central Australia is proving a hit in the Top End.
The spinifex hopping mouse has become a popular pet in Katherine.
And as vet Sam McMahon explains, you cannot cuddle them, but with their big eyes, kangaroo legs, and basil brush tail, they are great to watch.
"They're a very interesting pet, they can live quite happily in you know a reasonable sort of set up," he said.
"And they're very interesting to watch. They dig holes, they dig tunnels, they bound around, they're quite interesting to sort of sit there and stare at.

Govt calls for Q fever vaccine tenders
The Federal Government has called for tenders to produce Q fever vaccine as supplies of the drug reach critically low levels.
Q fever is a debilitating disease which mainly affects meat and livestock workers, and is transmitted through infected animals.
Though the tender process should be completed by next month, the Government says it is unlikely a new supplier will be found in time to prevent a vaccine shortage.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has criticised CSL for ending production and bulldozing the vaccine plant.
"The Government has called for expressions of interest for a tender to produce long term supplies of Q [fever] vaccine, it may well be that CSL will be a tenderer but there may be other companies as well," he said.

Key witness to front Cole inquiry
The Cole inquiry examining AWB's role in the oil-for-food scandal has been adjourned to a date to be fixed after hearing evidence last week from John Howard, Alexander Downer and Mark Vaile.
But there is at least one key witness still to come.
With public hearings all but finalised before Easter, senior counsel assisting John Agius informed Commissioner Terence Cole he would require him to sit again for several days after Anzac Day.
Mr Agius told the inquiry he was making arrangements for a witness to appear before the commission.
He later confirmed that witness to be Felicity Johnston, who worked for the UN's Office of Iraq program.
Mr Agius says the commission has obtained clearance from the United Nations but is still going through necessary protocols with the British Foreign Office.

Extreme weather events affecting rural commodities outlook
Cyclones and hurricanes continue to affect the outlook for rural commodities across mining, wheat and sugar markets.
The latest Commodity Price Index from the National Australia Bank is predicting a slight easing in rural prices over the next two years, with sugar, beef, wheat and cotton all expected to perform well.
Agribusiness economist Skye Dixon says extreme weather events have a big affect on rural prices.
"They do certainly have an impact because so much of rural commodity prices is derived from what's happening with supply," she said.

NSW drought worsens
New South Wales is slipping further back into drought, with 46 per cent of the State now drought declared.
That is up eight percentage points on last month.
Only 20 per cent New South Wales is considered satisfactory for rainfall.
But the State's Primary Industries Minister, Ian Macdonald, says despite worsening conditions, farmers are optimistic about a bigger winter crop than last year.
"The State needs widespread rain particularly in the north but also many areas in the south-west which are major cropping regions need a good downpour fairly quickly," he said.

Tomato plant virus spreading
There is confirmation today that the tomato yellow leaf curl virus is spreading in one of Australia's major production areas.
The virus stunts tomato growth and drastically limits yields.
Discovered for the first time in Australia a couple of weeks ago in Brisbane, it has now been identified on two commercial properties near Bundaberg.
Inspections are being planned in other Queensland tomato growing regions.
Chris Adriaansen from the Department of Primary Industries says it is proving difficult to trace the origin of the virus.
"This is what we're finding as we're going through all the properties that we're getting positive diagnosis on - there's no common linkage in terms they're not using the same supply of seedlings, they're not using the same supplier of anything, there's no other linkage," he said.

Protesters vow to continue gold mine protest
Environmentalists are continuing to picket a New South Wales gold mine over the use of cyanide, which they claim will permanently poison the local water supply.
The Lake Cowal open pit mine, in the state's central west, began processing recently but operations were shut down yesterday and a delivery of cyanide has reportedly been delayed.
Eight protesters have been charged with trespassing but Graham Dunstan from Cyanide Watch says the protest will continue until the mine is closed.
"This mining company has been granted water leases by the NSW Government to pump up 3,650 megalitres a year for this cyanide operation," he said.
"They leave this water behind permanently poisoned. Now in a time of drought giving people the equivalent of a Dubbo's water supply each year is profligate."

Search for grapevine genome moves a step closer
An Italian team of scientists has produced the world's first draft of the grapevine genome sequence.
The work, on the pinot noir variety, could lead to the development of high yielding, disease resistant grapes that still make good tasting wine.
Project leader with CSIRO Plant Industries, Doctor Mark Thomas, has been in close contact with the Italian team and says it is an important step towards the final grapevine gene map.
"Once the genome sequence is completed it will be the foundation I think for 21st century grape research as it will allow us to understand what genes are involved in grape quality and those genes that also control fruitfulness and yield," he said.
In Australia, the CSIRO has been working with a group in France trying to isolate the genes responsible for powdery mildew resistance and downey mildew resistance.

Growers satisfied with grape prices
Riverland grape growers who supply to wine giant McGuigan Simeon say they are satisfied with the fruit prices determined by an independent analyst.
The analyst was called in after a dispute arose over prices for grapes, many which had already been delivered to the winery.
Chris Byrne, from the Riverland Wine Grape Growers Association, says growers had been expecting to receive the lowest price.

Floodwaters affect search for banana prawns
Floodwaters and muddy river sediments are making it hard for trawlers in the Gulf of Carpentaria this season.
The banana prawn harvest began on Saturday, across the northern fishery.
Newfishing Australia's Steven Valentine says the fleet is being forced to use depth sounders to find the prawns.
"With the water clarity not being as it is - not very good, due to the mud slick - and we can't spot the mud boils, boats are having to rely heavily on their sounders, which means we don't cover the area quite so efficiently," he said.
"So it's been a pretty slow start to the season.
"Traditionally we road freight them out of Karumba. But, at the moment, with all the roads closed, we haven't got anywhere to send them to.
"Hopefully within the next four to five days, the rivers will drop enough so that the roads will be open and we can truck prawns out."
The Newfishing Australia fleet is hoping to catch up to 60 tonnes of banana prawns per trawler this season.

Bureaucracy to blame for closure, scallop fisher says
Tasmanian scallop fishers say they are fed up with a bureaucracy that has locked them out of the Bass Strait scallop fishery for the past six years.
Now the Federal Government says the fishery will remain closed for another three years.
Scallop fisherman Peter Stegmann says scientific advice showed a limited season was viable and blames overlapping Commonwealth and state fishing jurisdictions for the problem.
He says part of the $220 million earmarked for industry restructure should be spent sorting out the mess.

Study to focus on abalone habitat
A study on abalone habitat is about to get under way in south-west Victoria.
The information collected will be used to ensure the industry is managed sustainably.
Harry Peeters, from the Western Abalone Divers Association, says aerial imagery, sonar devices and underwater video will be used to help scientifically describe the seabed.
"Australia has one of the last sustainable wild catch abalone industries in the world," he said.
"Most of the others have been fished to extinction.

Nurseries to encourage kids to garden
The nursery industry is setting out to re-educate Australians about how to garden.
Market research has found gardening is losing market share from changing lifestyles, bigger houses, smaller gardens and a loss of skills.
The industry is fighting back and will soon launch a KidsGrow program, where local nurseries can work with schools to encourage children to garden.
Jenny Lambert, from the Nursery and Garden Industry Association, says gardening has social, educational and environmental benefits.
"The industry is concerned that the strength of the communities knowledge about gardening has dropped over the years and we're worried about where the next generation of gardeners is coming from," she said.

Global oil prices continue rising
Global oil prices continue to climb to record heights as Australia's grain growers prepare for this year's planting season.
Last night New York benchmark crude oil closed at more than $US70 a barrel for the first time in 23 years of trading.
Commodity analyst Tobin Gorey says running costs and fertiliser prices will rise further but there could be more demand for wheat and canola to make replacement biofuels.
"The costs are actually higher so people need to be compensating farmers and so on for producing it so it is profitable otherwise they won't stay in the business," he said.
"But the other side of that too is that demand for things like ethanol or biodiesel that creates further demand for oilseeds and grains as well.
"Perhaps that can also help boost the prices and is perhaps already influencing markets now to a small degree."
The combination of rising fuel and fertiliser costs is cause for concern for many farmers.
Graingrowers in South Australia's Mallee told Kerrie Lush cutting back on cropping is not an option and they are looking at other ways to reduce costs.
"We're certainly not cutting back on any acreage we're sowing but David's certainly going to try and do as much direct seeding without working up anything to save a bit of fuel that way," Val Gibbs from Wunkar said.
She says fertiliser prices are also far more expensive than last year.
"We have trialled putting zinc on through seed dressing instead of through fertiliser so that saves a bit of money that way."

Call for bureaucrat or MP to act as AWB 'moral conscience'
The Queensland Nationals are calling for changes at the top of AWB to help protect the single desk for wheat exports.
Member for Hinkler Paul Neville wants a bureaucrat or government MP on AWB's board to act as its "moral conscience" to stop future kickback controversies.
Mr Neville says the appointment would prevent questions over AWB's integrity if it retains the single desk.
"It's important that its probity be above any form of suspicion," he said.
"For that reason I'd be more comfortable if we had a government appointee or someone from the public service on that board."
Meanwhile tough international wheat marketing conditions have been reflected in AWB's first payment to growers from the 2005-06 national pool.
The dividend of just over $30 per metric tonne for Australian premium white (APW) grade wheat represents just 16 per cent of the total price growers can expect to receive.
Tony Smith from Plumgrove Commodity Trading says first payments are usually much higher but buyers are not prepared to pay higher grain prices.

Poppy grower contracts slashed
Pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline has slashed Tasmanian poppy grower contracts by 90 per cent.
Almost 500 poppy growers supply seed to the company with the lost contracts worth between $10 million and $12 million.
The company says there is a depression in world market prices and continuing oversupply.
Company researcher Dr Mike Doyle says the extraction plant will continue to run on existing stocks although the crop reduction will be for only one year.

Fruity fly precautions stall fruit, vege exports to Indonesia
Fruit and vegetable exports to Indonesia remain at a standstill, after the introduction of new import protocols to prevent an outbreak of fruit fly.
Exports of grapes, citrus, apples and pears are worth $35 million, but the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service says it has not issued any export permits on products affected by the new protocols, since they were imposed two weeks ago.
Australian growers say the conditions of spraying and inspection make exports to Indonesia uncommercial and is an effectively a ban on their produce.
A trade official was dispatched to Jakarta last week, and the Federal Government has now asked Indonesia to urgently revert to the previous import protocol.

Federal Govt funds target sugar industry
The Federal Government has handed over $36 million in the latest round of sugar industry reform.
Bundaberg Sugar will build a fertiliser production plant at its Tableland Mill, while the Proserpine Cooperative Sugar Milling Association will construct a plant to make a chemical from a cane by-product.

WA bananas sent east
A small number of Western Australian bananas have been sent to the eastern states after a sharp drop in demand.
After cyclone Larry destroyed the Queensland crop, WA growers vowed to stay loyal to their local customers.
But with bananas selling for about $6 a kilogram, shoppers decided to leave fruit on the shelf.
Kevin Leahy from Carnarvon's Sweeter Banana Co-operative says sending fruit east will not become a regular practice.
"A lot of bananas came in from Queensland that had come down obviously with the cyclone, they cleaned them up and sent them over and there was no demand," he said.

Push on for higher capital gains tax threshold
There are calls for the capital gains tax (CGT) threshold to be lifted to at least $10 million to protect farmers.
Combined assets worth more than $5 million mean farmers cannot access small business concessions on the tax.
It is starting to hit farm families when they try to expand, relocate or retire, because of rising property prices.
South Australian accountant Peter Hayes is part of a group that is lobbying federal politicians to increase the threshold, which has not changed for seven years.
"One client of mine wanted to relocate and their combined assets were in the order of $6 million, so they didn't comply with the CGT small business threshold and for them to move was going to cost them $1 million in tax," he said.

Canada records 5th mad cow case
Canada has confirmed its fifth case of mad cow disease.
But it is unlikely to cause further trade restrictions with the United States.
US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns says he expects no change in imports of Canadian beef and cattle under 30 months, after mad cow disease showed up in a six-year-old British Columbia dairy cow.
But Greg Doud, with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, says based on the cow's age there is a concern over the effectiveness of Canada's ban on feeding cow parts to cows, thought to spread the disease.
"Having the second animal that seems to be after the feed ban went into place in August of 1997... does seem to suggest that there is a feed ban compliance issue," he said.
The US resumed imports of younger Canadian animals and their meat last year, but still prohibits trade in older ones.

Mutton making comeback in UK
If you thought mutton was a cut of meat that went out with the war years and the depression, think again.
Sheep producers in the UK have started a Mutton Renaissance Club to improve mutton's image, which could increase Australia's already booming export market.
John Thorley from the UK National Sheep Association says they have had a lot of help from their high profile patron.
"Most people had given up on mutton a long, long time ago and then one or two people, his Royal Highness Prince Charles particularly, decided it was time we moved this thing on a bit," he said.

Govt looks to hot rocks power potential
The Victorian Government hopes hot granite rocks found underground will become a new source of green energy.
The rocks heat water pumped into the ground, turning it into steam, which is then used to create power.
The State Government has released 31 exploration permits across the state.
Oil industry consultant Terry Donohoe says the interest in hot rocks as a source of geothermal energy is growing.
"We know that Japan has got hot rocks and no other form of energy so the Japanese are very interested," he said.
"Also of course in South Australia, and recently the Queensland Government let out some exploration permits.

Urban dog owners take lead in sheepdog trials
City dog owners are starting to replace retired farmers on the sheepdog trial circuit.
The experts say they have noticed a big change, with city pet owners more interested in putting their dog and three sheep through an obstacle course, than competing in a traditional dog show.
Seven-time Australian representative Malcolm Taylor says while sheepdogs are being used less on the land, their popularity in the cities is growing.
"But I think the future for dog trialing is going to alter quite a bit and you'll see far more city dwellers that'll have a working dog in the city," he said.

Iraq finalises wheat purchase
The Iraqi Grains Board says it has finalised a $100 million wheat purchase from Australia after almost two months of negotiations.
Although the three companies selling the wheat say they have not yet signed a contract, the Grains Council of Australia believes terms have been agreed.
The head of the Iraq Grains Board Khalil Aassi has told reporters the country will buy 350,000 tonnes of wheat at $190 a tonne from the Wheat Australia consortium.
The deal was brokered by Trade Minister Mark Vaile, who visited Baghdad in February to save the Iraq wheat trade, after it announced it would no longer deal with monopoly exporter AWB because of the oil-for-food kickbacks scandal.
The deal with Wheat Australia, which includes ABB, GrainCorp and Cooperative Bulk Handling, breaks AWB's hold over wheat exports.
But the Grains Council's David Ginns says the deal will not be a lucrative one.
"As we know, time costs money and they certainly spent a lot of time and money on finalising this deal," he said.
Australia has traditionally supplied around a quarter of Iraq's wheat, making it Australia's third largest wheat market.

Critical months
Wheat exporter AWB says the next few months are critical for the global grain market, as weather conditions determine the size of the world crop.
Australian growers have already received a lower than expected return on the 2005-06 crop, largely due to fluctuating demands for hard wheat varieties and tough international marketing conditions.
And general manager of AWB International, Sarah Scales, says global demand remains subdued.
"I think the next couple of months are very critical, I think it's make or break as far as the world wheat market goes for the next 12 months, depending on particularly rain conditions in the hard red winter wheat belt of the United States," she said.

Graincorp to close 100 silos
Grain handling company Graincorp has confirmed it will close around 100 silos in the eastern states as part of a company restructure.
As the major grain handler for the eastern states, Graincorp currently maintains 320 silo sites but now plans to close almost a third.
Queensland will lose 23, Victoria 32, with 38 to go in New South Wales.
Workers at the silos were told about the closures yesterday, but were also told their jobs were safe.
Graincorp says the changes are in line with what growers want, which is better rates on rail services and a trend to using larger full-service silos.
Rodeo organisers in Tasmania say they will not call off a national titles competition this weekend despite vandals destroying an arena.
Only days ago the power box at the Harveydale Rodeo Arena was smashed to pieces and some time in the past 48 hours vandals entered the private property with wire cutters and shredded the perimeter fence.
Rodeo Tasmania claims the offenders were people driven to action by a high-profile campaign against rodeo's in recent times.
That campaign has been spearheaded by Against Animal Cruelty Tasmania, which says it had nothing with the vandalism but concedes their campaign may have spurred others into action.
"The public see what goes on at events they wouldn't normally go to but somebody out there may have been compelled to take direct action after they've seen disturbing footage that we've ween on television," spokeswoman Emma Haswell said.

Money flows at Easter yearling sales
The Easter yearling sales in Sydney have had a record $43 million opening day.
Seven horses sold for more than $1 million each, with a top price of $2 million for a colt by Redoute's Choice.
The horse will be trained by David Hayes in Victoria.
Jonathon Darcy from William Inglis and Son says the buoyant world economy has seen an increase in overseas buyers.
"The strength of the stock market in both Tokyo and in Hong Kong has really driven this in the last 12 to 18 months," he said.
"Five years ago both of those economies were under a fair bit of pressure following the SARS outbreak.

Feed running low on stock routes
The long paddock is getting crowded around Narrabri, in north-west New South Wales, where 25,000 head of livestock are searching for feed on the stock routes.
Twelve thousand cattle and 13,000 sheep have been on the road in recent weeks, with the routes almost at full capacity.
Jamie Maddox from the Narrabri Rural Lands Protection Board, says it will be a harsh winter for many graziers already short of feed and water.
"We received some good late January/early February rain, which gave us a good body of feed but it's almost all disappeared now and it's certainly becoming dry," he said.
"A few dams in certain areas are drying up quickly and becoming boggy.

'Pressure on negotiators' to secure better market access
Sheepmeat producers are confident their latest round of talks with the European Commission will lead to a bigger slice of the export market for Australia.
Industry delegates have met with EU commissioners in Brussels to push Australia's case ahead of world trade talks later this month.
Ian Feldtman from the Sheepmeats Council says the pressure is now on trade negotiators to clinch a deal.
"The message we're giving to our Government is that the decisions that are made during this round is something that our industry is going to have to live with for at least the next 10 years," he said.

Aust to increase agricultural aid to East Timor
Australia's direct involvement in rebuilding East Timor with agricultural aid is set to increase.
The Australian Ambassador to East Timor says more than $40 million will be invested in aid this year, with agriculture representing $1.5 million.
Margaret Twomey says a new proposal aims to improve water harvesting and sanitation for remote communities across the rugged nation.
"And we are now in talks with the Government and specifically the Prime Minister about a much bigger, more ambitious program, that would last up to 10 years, cost somewhere up to $50 million, to get clean water and sanitation to 80 per cent of the people in this country," she said.

Texas weather could impact on Aust cotton prices
Prolonged dry conditions in the American state of Texas could see a lift in cotton prices in Australia.
A global oversupply of cotton and the high Australian dollar are hurting returns for growers at present, with prices well below $400 a bale.
But Cliff White from Queensland Cotton says if the situation in the United States deteriorates, prices for next season could rise above $430 a bale.
"I think it's difficult to see significant change to current crop prices, however over the next few weeks attention is going to be turning more so to the new crop production prospects in the northern hemisphere and at the moment there are one or two concerns on the horizon," he said.

Fruit fly outbreak could affect Tas market access
A fruit fly outbreak has been detected at the Northern Territory's largest table grape producer.
The central Australian town of Ti-Tree reported an isolated outbreak last month but recent tests now show the pest has spread to nearby Territory Grapes.
Horticulture advisory officer Geoff Kenna says the finding could affect market access to Tasmania.

Apple packhouse set for $2m upgrade
Australia's biggest apple packhouse is launching a multi-million dollar upgrade.
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran will unveil the $2 million upgrade of the Batlow Fruit Co-operative in southern NSW which features Australia's first automatic blemish sorting system for apples.
The technology has been imported from New Zealand and second grade fruit is identified electronically and then removed from the premium packing line.
It is expected to increase its efficiency.
The grower-owned co-operative was established in 1922 and produces 6,000 bins of apples each year.
The district's growers are suffering after prices fell last year under the weight of a big crop and imported apple juice.
It is well recognised that the gap between city-slickers and their country cousins is growing.
But farmers are out to restore their image by holding a National Farm Day next month.
Victorian wool producer Debbie Bain says farm gates will be opened to city people to help them better understand decisions made on a working property.
"If we have somebody up here and we are bringing sheep into drench them, why do we give them these chemicals? We're shoving these chemicals down their throats, what for?" she said.
"But when you explain about worm burden and and the detrimental [effect] that worms have on sheep, they'll suddenly understand a little bit more about chemical use in animals."

Drought program speeds up aid applications
Farmers will get faster access to drought assistance under new changes unveiled by state and federal agriculture ministers today.
They are the first in a raft of drought assistance changes farmers hope to see over the next six months.
The National Agricultural Monitoring System (NAMS) is expected to slash the time it takes to gather the information farmers need to lodge a drought assistance application.
It will provide instant online rainfall, soil moisture, crop yield and commodity price information, streamlining contact between farmers and local, state and federal governments.
Vice-president of the National Farmers Federation (NFF) Charles Burke says there needs to be fundamental change to the way drought assistance is delivered but this is a positive first step that will help farmers.
"It'll really give an overall picture of say one particular region and how it's performing in a drought," he said.

Money laundering law changes 'draconian'
Rural bank branches and agencies could be under threat from proposed changes to federal money laundering legislation.
While the laws are designed to target organised crime, a report by the Chartered Secretaries of Australia says it will be too hard for many smaller bank agencies to comply.
Chief executive Tim Sheehy says banks will need to have personal contact with clients, there will be changes to identification requirements and big fines.
"They are draconian, they're unfortunately a one size fits all approach," he said.
"The way that the proposed legislation is, there's no difference in penalties for a fairly minor transgression or a major $10 million one if you're an agent.
"[When] you're faced with the risk of a major penalty for a small error, you're probably going to pull out of the business."

Truck drivers 'living below poverty line'
New research shows the families of truck drivers are suffering from record fuel prices, drought and long working hours.
More than 70 per cent of the nation's transport fleet is made up of small operators and the report by the Transport Women of Australia Association says tough times are being felt everywhere.
Spokeswoman Pam McMillan says the study backs up anecdotal evidence.
"We did find that some operators are living below the poverty line and more than what we would like to consider," she said.
"They might have a nice house but perhaps can't afford to buy decent groceries every week and it's not that they're being frivolous, it's just that the money's not out there.

Debate intensifies about fuel alternatives as oil prices rise
Oil prices are not getting any better with the price of West Texas crude jumping again last night to $US72 a barrel.
As prices go up, debate is intensifying about fuel alternatives.
Bruce Robinson from the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas says Australia could halve its transport fuel usage by minimising its dependence on cars.
He says fuel taxes should be increased similar to the system introduced by former prime minister Margaret Thatcher in United Kingdom in the 1980s.
"If we continue to provide very cheap petrol and to give excise free petrol to everyone and subsidise it as happens in Queensland then we are just going to continue down the oil dependence [road]," he said.
"The enormous legacy Margaret Thatcher has left to Britain, she's given the price signals that oil is going to be more expensive then they are not nearly so dependent on cheap fuel as we are."
The higher price of crude oil is causing investors to take a closer look at the biofuels industry.
A new ethanol plant opens in the US every 10 days and around the world millions of dollars are being poured into biofuel projects to reduce dependence on oil.
Agribusiness investment adviser Shane Kelly says Australian investors are also keen to back a local ethanol industry.
"It's fair to say that as oil prices increase, the interest in ethanol plants has increased markedly," he said.

Cyclone causes minor damage
There has been big rainfall in the wake of cyclone Monica in far north Queensland.
The category three cyclone cross the north-east coast late yesterday but does not appear to have caused too much damage.
Cyclone Monica followed almost exactly the same path as cyclone Ingrid which ripped through the region about 13 months ago.
Monica hit land just south of the Lockhart Aboriginal community.
Very few commercial fishing boats were sheltering in Lockhart River's mangroves and so far there has been no reports of major incidents.
On cattle properties in the cyclone's path the strong winds brought down some branches, trees, sheds and fences but overall damage has been minor.
Tom Burns manages Orchid Creek station and he says his biggest problem was finding his dogs.

Wheat bug discovery prompts questions
Australian apple growers say the discovery of the wheat bug in Holland and Belgium raises new questions about the risks posed by New Zealand apple imports.
Biosecurity Australia is considering 34 submissions on the proposal to allow kiwi apples into Australia.
Chairman of Apple and Pear Australia Darral Ashton says the wheat bug is endemic in New Zealand and should be given greater consideration.
"News out of both Belgium and Holland that that wheat bug has been found and they are saying it arrived hitchhiking on New Zealand apples or New Zealand apple packaging," he said.
"Whether that's true or not I don't know but it just highlights the concern that one of the processes has to be fumigation because while wheat bug may not affect the Batlow or the Australian apple and pear industry it would sure as hell play havoc on the Australian wheat industry."

New company secretary appointed to AWB
AWB has appointed a new company secretary, lawyer Logan Armstrong.
The appointment comes after the resignations of Dr Richard Fuller and Jim Cooper as company secretaries last week.

Broadacre grain growers want more debate over herbicide
Western Australian broadacre grain growers say they will fight to keep using the herbicide 2,4-D Ester to control summer weeds.
The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority has suggested deregistering some forms of 2,4-D after claims chemical drift has affected other crops and the environment.
But farmers say they have successfully managed the herbicide for 50 years with safeguards to protect horticultural and agricultural crops.
Phil Patterson from the Gnowangerup area of the great southern grain belt says there needs to be more debate.
"Let's sit back for a minute. Ester has been around for what 50 or 60 years and I'm getting a bit sick of these experts in Canberra trying to put their ideas on the rest of the world," he said.
"I mean let them have a look at what was done in WA in the eighties and work from there.

Better prices expected for barley growers
Barley growers in South Australia can expect slightly better prices for their grain this year.
Malting barley prices will only rise by a couple of dollars but feed prices are expected to jump by up to $25 a tonne to $170.

Lack of skilled workers limiting new water projects
Attempts to fix Australia's water shortage problems are suffering because a scarcity of skilled workers.
Delegates at a National Water Conference in Alice Springs have heard that a lack of qualified experts is limiting the development of new water saving projects.
Chief executive of the Australian Water Association Chris Davis says the most severe shortages are in the science and engineering field.
"Most organisations tend to be populated by middle-aged men who are about to retire in a year or two's time so we're staring down the barrel of an even worse shortage in a couple of years from now," he said.

Salt interception project to benefit Murray River
A project to stop thousands of tonnes of salt entering the Murray River has just been opened near Kerang in north-west Victoria.
The $13 million salt interception project will pump saline groundwater from Pyramid Creek into evaporation basins.
The salt will then be commercially harvested instead of flowing into the Murray.
Goulburn Murray Water's Carl Mather says the project will benefit both farmers and the environment.
"The scheme will stop approximately 22,000 tonnes of salt reaching the River Murray," he said.

Record price set for yearling at Sydney sale
The thoroughbred industry has set a new record price for a yearling at the Easter sales in Sydney.
South African trainer Charles Laird paid $3 million for a Redoutes' Choice colt last night, beating the previous record of $2.5 million.
The record came as a surprise for the breeder.
It is the best ever yearling sale on Australian soil.
After two days of selling, buyers have spent $68 million on 240 lots, with the average price at more than $100,000 above the previous year.
Breeder of the $3 million colt Arthur Mitchell of the Yarraman Park Stud in the Hunter Valley agreed there was some luck needed but says breeding judgment helped.
"We started to get a bit of a whisper that the few Redoutes' were going quite well and we needed a stallion with a bit of size," Mr Mitchell said.

Govt's hands tied in water trading dispute
The Federal Government says it is powerless to intervene in a cross-border dispute which is holding up water reform.
Three states have been fined millions of dollars for failing to meet agreed targets on interstate water trading.
Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia will have $10 million, $13 million and $3 million in competition payments withheld respectively, opening up a new row between them and the Federal Government.
South Australia and Victoria claim they are being punished for New South Wales failing to agree on their trading model but the Iemma Government says it has met all of its water trading requirements.
National Water Commission chairman Ken Matthews will not buy into which states are responsible for the hold-up.
"I'm not taking sides among the states, all three states have been working hard," he said.
But Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says the Federal Government has no constitutional powers to end the state stand-off.
"That is the constitutional reality," he said.
Victoria and South Australia have agreed on an exchange rate system of open-border trading but New South Wales is calling for a different model which takes into account its lower security water entitlements.
Minister for the River Murray in South Australia Karlene Maywald says she is bitterly disappointed because an agreement on water trading reform has been reached with Victoria.
"We believe that's grossly unfair and we think that South Australia is being docked $3 million when we have done everything we can to ensure that our borders are open," she said.

Govt urged to buy Snowy Hydro scheme
The Federal Government is being called on to buy Snowy Hydro and keep it as a publicly-owned water and power asset.
The call was unanimously made at an angry meeting of 350 people at Cooma, in southern New South Wales last night, who are opposed to the joint state and federal sell-off.
The scheme is expected to earn $3 billion if the sale goes ahead this year, but Snowy River Mayor Richard Wallace says public ownership is much more important.

Incentives vital to NSW timber industry: Visy exec
The timber industry says regional development will suffer if tax breaks for plantations are scrapped in next month's Budget.
The Federal Government is reviewing tax benefits for timber plantations under the Managed Investment Scheme.
But the chief executive officer of Visy Industries, Harry Debney, says retaining the incentives is vital to plans to build a second timber mill in southern New South Wales.
"We do need a long term sustainable timber industry and the investment scheme has really encouraged that softwood planting," he said.
"So I guess if the region and the country want another for example $400 million investment in Tumut that is really fundamental to it.

GrainCorp's silos closure plan angers farming groups
Anger is mounting among eastern states' farming groups about plans by GrainCorp to close more than 100 grain receival sites.
Some farmers say the decision will force them to travel up to 100 kilometres more to deliver grain.
North-west Victorian farmer Rod Bishop says he will need to purchase another truck to be able to cart grain more efficiently.
And he says others might be left with no choice but to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to set up on-farm grain storage.
"I personally don't like it that much because you have to market the grain, keep the weevils out and all those issues come into it but you certainly couldn't discount doing it, that's for sure," he said.
GrainCorp chairman Don Taylor says the company will consider keeping the silos open if growers can guarantee supply.
The grain handler has closed most sites which process less than 5,000 tonnes of grain.
Mr Taylor says GrainCorp's also willing to look at selling old infrastructure to farmers but does not think growers will be interested.

Wool industry's survival dependent on young shoppers: designer
Enticing young shoppers to wool is critical to the industry's survival, according to the head of leading men's fashion house, Ermenegildo Zegna.
The company will hold its annual awards in Melbourne tonight for wool producers from Argentina, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia.
Count Paolo Zegna says his challenge is to get his daughters interested in wearing more wool.
"What worries me the most is not what has happened until now, but what could happen in the future if the young generation of consumers don't get the message from wool," he said.

Average rainfall expected over next few months
With many farmers looking anxiously for the autumn break, the latest prediction suggests average rainfall is likely from May to July across the country.

Monica gathers strength
Tropical cyclone Monica continues to gather strength as it moves steadily west over the Gulf of Carpentaria.
The new managers of a remote cattle station in the Northern Territory are urgently stocking up on supplies.
Mainoru Station's Scott Woltman says his life in central Queensland did not prepare him for the wild weather.
"It's all new, we don't get mixed up with these sorts of things in central Queensland where we come from," he said.

Diamond production drops
The big wet season in the Kimberley in WA, has contributed to a 40 per cent drop in diamond production.

Stud owner 'optimistic' about online sale
Stud cattle are being sold exclusively on the Internet for the first time today.
Traditionally sales are conducted in person by agents with online selling offered as an additional feature.
Tanholm Limousin stud owner Kjedl Sorenson, from the Darling Downs in Queensland, says the sale has attracted interest from across Australia.
"I'm not nervous, but I'm curious to see how it goes," he said.

Fodder export company invests in Douglas-Daly region
Despite a moratorium on land clearing and uncertainty over water allocations, development in the Douglas-Daly region, 200 kilometres south of Darwin, is still going ahead.
Northern Australia Fodder Exports has bought the first of what it hopes will be a number of properties growing alfalfa for the Japanese and Korean dairy markets.
Chief executive officer Peter Ryan says there will be an initial investment of around $10 million, as a sign of faith in the region's future.
"I believe that it presents great opportunities and great natural advantages with the quality and the size of the water resource, and the climatic advantages coupled with the geographic advantages," he said.

Landcare popularity wanes
While Landcare is approaching its 20th anniversary in Victoria, a new survey shows it is not as popular as it used to be.
Over the past six years, more than 4,000 Victorians have left the movement and the number of groups has also declined.
Survey author and director of the Institute for Land, Water and Society, Professor Allan Curtis, says there are a number of reasons why people are leaving.

Tweed farmer picks up environmental award
A sugar cane farmer from northern New South Wales has been named Australia's best environmentally friendly farmer.
Robert Quirk received the 16th McKell Medal for excellence in natural resource management at a ceremony in Sydney this morning.
A farmer in the Tweed Valley for 44 years, Mr Quirk says he is dedicated to improving soils, reducing chemical use and fertiliser run-off while increasing productivity and profitability.
"It is possible to do environmental stewardship, increase your bottom line and have better outcomes all round for both the environment, the farming community and the longevity of the sugar industry, and other industries," he said.

Nullabor Muster set to boost remote town's population
The population of the isolated Western Australian town of Rawlinna is set to boom as people arrive for the annual Nullabor Muster.
The muster is not just the main event for pastoralists on the Nullabor, it is their own event for the year.
And by tonight there will be literally hundreds of swags dotted across the ground.
It is a long way from anywhere, about four hours east of Kalgoorlie-Boulder on the railway line which connects the east and west of Australia.

Farmers expected to get tax concessions
Farmers look set to win capital gains tax concessions in the federal Budget to cut the cost of passing down family farms.
There could also be a billion dollar budget bonus for rural roads with the National party believed to have secured money to link strategic roads to ports.
Currently many farmers pay huge capital gains tax bills when they sell their farm because rising rural land prices have pushed their farm value above a $5 million threshold.
The National Farmers Federation (NFF) says that means producers can no longer access small business tax concessions, making farm succession planning a costly process.
Reports now suggest the Government will allow more farmers to get the tax concession.
NFF chief executive Ben Fargher says the mooted changes make sense.
"Current rules mean farmers are clicked out of being able to access those exemptions, we've asked the Government to look at it," he said.
There is also speculation the Government is considering a $1 billion roads package aimed at Queensland's Bruce and Hume Highways.
Nationals leader Mark Vaile will not confirm the spending but says he is in favour of more roads funding.

AWB 'apology document' suppression ruling looms
A bid by wheat exporter AWB to stop the release of an "apology document" is being heard in the Federal Court in Melbourne.
Earlier this month the AWB board voted to lodge the court challenge to AWB inquiry Commissioner Terence Cole's decision to lift a non-publication order on the document, which was prepared for the company last year.
The document was written by a crisis management expert, who suggested the company take a strategy of "over-apology".
Commissioner Cole ruled the document was not prepared for the purpose of legal advice and so could be published.
An AWB spokesman said the board felt the document, and others to do with AWB's internal investigation into the scandal, should be protected by legal professional privilege.
Former managing director Andrew Lindberg has told the court he engaged a US public relations consultant to put together the statement of contrition ,which would be presented to the Cole inquiry.
Under cross-examination he denied the statement was prepared for PR purposes but maintained it was part of the company's legal strategy.
However Mr Lindberg acknowledged any statement to the inquiry would attract widespread publicity.
The court is expected to make a decision today on whether to release the document.

Acting CEO resigns
Meanwhile AWB is looking for someone to fill its top job following the resignation of acting chief executive Peter Polson.
Mr Polson replaced Mr Lindberg but in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, AWB says he wants to concentrate on other business interests.
Mr Polson will continue to be an AWB director.
Executive chairman Brendan Stewart will step into the vacancy until a new CEO is found.

Credibility damaged
In another development, a survey shows the credibility of the Federal Government and wheat exporter AWB has been damaged by the oil-for-food scandal.
Roy Morgan Research has surveyed more than 650 people living in rural and metropolitan areas about their perceptions of AWB and the Government since the Cole inquiry began.
Director Gary Morgan says the public is not accepting the message being pushed by the Government about its knowledge of the deals and most have questions about AWB.
"Sixty-five per cent said they did not act ethically, only 12 per cent said they did," Mr Morgan said.
"We asked the question: 'Do you think the Prime Minister John Howard acted ethically on this issue or not'.
"Fifty-four per cent said no, he did not act ethically, 29 per cent said he did, 17 per cent were undecided.
"We asked the same question about Alexander Downer. Fifty-six per cent said 'he did not act ethically'.

Darwin residents prepare for Monica's onslaught
Preparations for tropical cyclone Monica are under way across the city of Darwin in the Northern Territory.
The category 5 system has already created major disruptions with commercial fishing.
As tropical cyclone Monica tracks west across the Gulf of Carpentaria, many of the 75 prawn trawlers that fish the remote off-shore regions took shelter in calmer waters to the south near Karumba and the Northern Territory-Queensland border.
Others steamed back to their northern ports such as the Francis Bay Mooring Basin in Darwin.
The interruption to the banana prawn harvest has created at least one week of disrupted fishing time and wasted fuel in not ideal fishing grounds.
One of the largest companies, NewFishing Australia, estimates the disruption will cost them tens of thousands of dollars.
It is an unusual sight to see trawlers and fishing vessels in the Darwin Port in the middle of the season which ends in just under one month.
They are being double lashed to moorings with ropes and packed in tight side by side with tyre fenders between them to reduce friction.
And the level of water in this mooring basin will be dropped to allow these large vessels to rest on the bottom for the worst of the weather. 

Flooding
And rain from cyclone Monica is causing the worst floods in living memory in parts of far north Queensland.
Residents from a Cape York Peninsula aboriginal community and at least three families from cattle properties have been airlifted to drier ground.
Glen Shephard from Lilyvale Station, near Princess Charlotte Bay, says he has never seen anything like it
"Wednesday afternoon it started to rain and by about seven o'clock the next morning we'd had seven inches so the water was starting to tickle our toes, sort a thing," he said.
"It came through the house about fourteen or fifteen inches ... had to walk across the airstrip to get over on a bit of high ground.
"It's always a concern about crocs in this country [but] ... I didn't tell the kids that."
Senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology David Alexander says Monica is one of the most perfect cyclone systems he has seen.
He says it is far more dangerous than cyclone Larry which caused massive destruction in far north Queensland last month.
"It's probably the best developed cyclone I have seen in many, many years," he said.
"It's got a perfect circular eye, it's right at the top of a category 5 range, so it's a very, very severe cyclone.

Egg producers unhappy at adjustment package rejection
Egg producers are furious that a meeting of state and federal primary industries ministers has refused to endorse a $23 million adjustment package.
The funds would have helped farmers to leave the sector if they could not afford to upgrade to bigger hen cages under new animal welfare laws.
President Jeff Ironside says the changes are being imposed by government and compensation should be paid.
"Unfortunately you can't do anything with the old systems because they don't lend themselves to tampering with the size," he said.
"So egg producers virtually have to go out and buy new equipment to comply with the new regulations because it is around about 50 bucks a bird, you know a farm with 20,000 birds, a million dollars."

McGuigan Simeon rejects analyst's prices
Wine giant McGuigan Simeon has told growers in the Riverland and Sunraysia it will not accept prices set by an independent analyst last week.
The analyst was called into settle a dispute over how much the winery was prepared to pay growers for grapes already delivered.
Chris Byrne from the Riverland Wine Grape Growers Association says the company must now explain why it will not accept the prices.

High bacteria levels stop oyster production
Oyster production in the Bellinger River on New South Wales mid-north coast has been halted due to unacceptably high levels of E. coli.
The New South Wales Food Authority has stopped harvesting Sydney Rock Oysters indefinitely.
John Lindsay from the Bellinger Oyster Growers Association says growers are shocked and more should have been done earlier by authorities.
"We're all extremely surprised because we always thought the Bellinger River was one of the pristine rivers," he said.
"We always thought it was one of the best rivers on the north coast. Obviously not. We knew there were some problems in there.
"We've been onto council, we've been onto the Food Authority to try and clear up some hot spots.

Farmers hit out at dept land clearing inspection methods
Farmers in western New South Wales have vowed to prevent state Department of Natural Resources officials from entering their properties to conduct land clearing inspections.
The farmers are angry at recent compliance checks where the department used a police escort.
Doug Menzies says 200 farmers who attended a meeting in Nyngan are fed up with what they say is unworkable legislation and heavy handed government approach.
"We've tried every legal avenue we can and we just get stonewalled every time," he said.

Irrigators confident of accessing water from gas reserves
Southern Queensland irrigators are confident they will be next in line to access vast amounts of water from underground coal seam gas reserves.
The Federal Government has announced a $10 million project to allow the Dalby Town Council to use 1,000 megalitres of water extracted along with natural gas by Arrow Energy.
Cotton grower Paul McVeigh says irrigators are making an application to the National Water Commission so they access the water.
"The challenges I suppose this is new water, it's water that's never been available before and I think the exciting side of it is that at this stage you know water is probably the biggest issue in the whole Australian community and here we are sitting on a great asset," he said.

Potato harvesters dig up WWII mortar bomb
A team of potato harvesters in northern Tasmania dug up more than they bargained for at the weekend - a World War II mortar bomb.
Army bomb disposal experts were flown from Melbourne to the Campbell Town farm and declared the rusty three kilogram bomb to be a harmless practice round.
Major Danny Rowe says they are called out to Tasmania on average once a month and only 10 per cent of bombs are found to be live.
"Some of the areas around here were used during the war and post war as practice ranges, for troops that were billeted down in Tasmania, so some of these areas have old ammunition on them that have been fired during the war," he said.

McGauran denies breaking promise over fruit code of conduct
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has been accused of breaking an election promise, by not including the big supermarkets in a mandatory code of conduct for the fruit and vegetable sector.
Despite concerns within his own party, Mr McGauran is expected to take the code to Cabinet tomorrow.
National Party backbenchers say the Government is not delivering on what it promised.
In a statement during the election former leader John Anderson said the code would give producers a fairer deal on terms of trade and in resolving disputes with produce buyers, who are in many instances large supermarket chains.
Member for Mallee John Forrest says the Government may as well not have the code at all if it does not include the big retailers.
"To leave them out isn't delivering what we said we would deliver," he said.
The Government also faces a legal challenge from wholesale markets who are included in the code.
Central Markets Association spokesman Andrew Young says the current plan gives supermarkets an unfair advantage over market wholesalers.
"It should be workable and right now we're facing something which in many respects doesn't meet any of those criteria," he said.
But Mr McGauran denies he is breaking an election promise and says the code was never meant to include retailers like Coles and Woolworths.
He says the real problems for growers occur when they send produce to market wholesalers.
"Retailers were never part of the election commitment which was written down," he said.

Citrus company blocks canker surveillance officials
One of Australia's major citrus growing companies has closed its gates to Queensland's citrus canker surveillance authorities.
The discovery of canker at Emerald in 2004 decimated the local industry, with the destruction of tens of thousands of fruit trees.
2PH Farms says the blockade is to support local orchardist Maurie Iddles, who missed out on financial assistance in the wake of the outbreak.
Craig Pressler of 2PH says it was not an easy choice, with both farmers risking their plans to replant orchards next year.
"Well the decision wasn't taken lightly," he said.
"We wish to support Maurie and Connie in their fight for fair and equitable treatment with regards to compensation.

NZ apple growers hit back at wheat bug claims
Kiwi apple growers are angry at claims a native New Zealand wheat bug was spread to Europe by apple packaging.
Australian growers say the discovery of wheat bug in Belgium and Holland could raise new concerns about the risks posed by New Zealand apple imports.
But Peter Beaven from Pipfruit New Zealand says a study has shown the pest has a limited ability to survive cool storage.
"We don't believe for a moment it got there on apples it must have got there on some other commodity that's not cool stored or on the clothing of tourists," he said.

Decision reserved on AWB 'apology' document
A Federal Court Judge has reserved his decision on whether to make AWB's so-called apology document public.
In hearings yesterday AWB argued the apology was drafted as part of the company's legal preparations for the Cole Inquiry.
Appearing as a witness for AWB, former managing director Andrew Lindberg told the court fellow board member Peter Polson had recommended a US public relations consultant to help draft the apology, given his experience with crisis management.
Mr Polson resigned as acting chief executive of the company last Friday.
But counsel for the Commonwealth said the main purpose for the draft apology was to influence public opinion and help AWB's public relations strategy, by submitting the document to the Inquiry.
Justice Young has reserved his decision for a date to be set.

S Africa begins Iraq kickback inquiry
South Africa has established its own version of the Cole inquiry, into allegations of kickbacks to the former Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein.
Eight South African companies have been subpoenaed to appear at the Donen Commission.
Public hearings will begin in two weeks and will investigate illegal oil surcharges, after-sales-service-fees and inland transportation fees paid to Iraqi officials.
Secretary of the commission, Matsepo Mobeng says the South African government has looked to Australia's example.

Cyclone Monica downgraded
Darwin residents are breathing a bit easier today, with tropical Cyclone Monica downgraded to a category 1 system this morning.
Remote pearl farms too appear to have been spared major damage from the cyclone, which had been rated a destructive category five yesterday.
Chris Barnard from Arafura Pearls, north of Nhulunbuy says it is a lucky escape.
"As the winds intensified, we would have got up to about 180-200km/hr winds," he said.
"We were lucky this cyclone season in the NT. Unfortunately what I have heard from WA is that they have had a bit of a rough time. But in the NT we were saved this season. It was just a reminder to be on your toes the whole time. You never know when one might hit, even as late as it is in this season."

Stormy weather causes diamond price drop
The stormy weather across northern Australia is affecting the price of diamonds.
Production at the world's biggest diamond mine, Argyle Diamonds in WA, dropped significantly in the first quarter due to wet weather.
Diamond expert James McGlew says the production drop, along with a rush of diamond buying worldwide, is going to make a sparkler much more expensive.
"I mean over the last three years we've seen average price rises totalling about 60 per cent in price," he said.

Cazaly court action chances 'relatively slim'
A resources analyst says a Federal Court bid over the rights to an iron ore tenement in Western Australia's north-west has little chance of success.
Cazaly Resources pegged the large deposit in September when it become clear mining giant Rio Tinto had forgotten to renew its lease.
Mines Minister John Bowler has ruled the land be returned to Rio, resulting in a $75 million loss for Cazaly shareholders on the stock exchange yesterday.
But Hartley's Rob Brierley says Cazaly's court action could be in vain.

McGuigan denies grower grape prices claims
Wine giant McGuigan Simeon has denied grower claims it will not pay new grape prices set by an independent analyst.
Grower associations in the Riverland and Murray Valley claim the winery has written to growers saying it will not accept the new prices.
But chief executive Dane Hudson says there has been a misunderstanding.

New techniques found to reduce fishing deaths
A four year project has shown commercial anglers can use long lines for deep sea fishing without killing thousands of seabirds.
In the past trailing baited hooks behind trawlers in Antarctic waters has caused the deaths of up to 3,000 birds a year.
Techniques, including quickly sinking hooks and hauling them in differently, have reduced sea bird deaths to zero.
Les Scott from fishing company Petuna Sealord says other countries should follow Australia's lead.
"The statistics show that the mitigation methods work because if you look at our neighbours their bird mortality is still 2,000 plus," he said.

East Timor joins in Anzac services
A special Anzac Day dawn service has been held in Dili, the capital of East Timor.
It has commemorated 11 Australian soldiers believed to have died there in 1942.
During World War II, Australia's Sparrow Force worked deep in the rugged mountain jungles of East Timor.
Helio Tavares says they conducted guerrilla operations against the Japanese and were supported by the Timorese people.
"During World War II the Timorese, supported the Australians, because they didn't want East Timor to be invaded by the Japanese Army," he said.
"Throughout the four years of struggle, up to 44,000 Timorese died assisting Australian soldiers.
"The Timorese really value that relationship with Australia and we can see it today.
"The Prime Minister addressing the people and saying that Australia is a very important neighbour and a partner in the development of the country."
The school of the air in outback Queensland is also getting into the Anzac spirit.
A group of students from cattle stations in the Richmond area west of Townsville has spent weeks practising the national anthem to perform for the local Anzac parade.

Teleworking project aimed at helping rural women
A new project is trying to get more rural women in jobs without having to leave home.
Teleworking would allow women to utilise their education and professional experience without the need to travel long distances.
Chris Capel from the Foundation for Australian Agricultural Women says getting companies to take on teleworkers is the biggest challenge.
"It'll be convincing employers and business [that] will be the major hurdle I think," she said.

Mulesing replacement trial axed
The race to find an alternative to sheep mulesing by 2010 has hit a major hurdle, with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) banning a key product being used in trials.
Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) has been injecting collagenase into sheep's backsides to inhibit the growth of wool.
But the trials have now been dumped, with AQIS warning the biological agent poses a biosecurity risk and could carry mad cow disease.
AWI's Scott Williams says while it is costly to lose the research, other trials are in progress.
"It's always costly to try and do R&D at the sort of pace we're doing it at because we've only got a very short deadline, of course," he said.
"That means you sometimes duplicate things because you can't afford to fail, so we've had, you know, three or four different fronts moving forward at once, even though we may only need one or two of those.

Court opposes chicken meat producers' bid for joint action
Farmers have lost a five year legal battle for the right to band together to refuse to supply processors.
The court action was launched by Victoria's chicken meat producers, who wanted to set a precedent for other farmers with limited contract options, including the potato, wine grape and dairy sectors.
Under the Trade Practices Act, individuals can refuse to supply produce, but not groups.
President of the Victoria Farmers' Federation's chicken meat group, John Clarke, says the Federal Court's decision is a blow.
"The processors are dealing opportunistically with growers and abusing their market power but they haven't seen fit, or the tribunal hasn't seen fit, to go the extra step and give us [the] right to have countervailing power.

Grain growers' future not looking rosy
Changing weather patterns, weed resistance and higher input costs are putting pressure on grain farm incomes, despite more land being cropped than ever before.
In the short term, farm incomes will go up but figures from ABARE and the Grains Research and Development Corporation, say the picture is not as rosy further out.
Increased production in Australia and strong global competition will keep grain prices low.
Agricultural analyst Neil Clark says average-sized farmers have tough times ahead.
"The price of grain has been falling at about an average of 2.2 per cent for the last 28 years and yet we all know that the costs of fertiliser, fuel and in particular debt servicing are going to be at an all time high for the coming cropping season and the commodity prices aren't all that great yet," he said.
"It's always great for the top 25 per cent and if we look at any of the ABARE studies they do shine.

Lack of rain doesn't prevent crop sowing
Crop sowing is under way in some parts of the country, despite the lack of a significant autumn break in Australia's south-east.
Plenty of unseasonal summer rain has led Western Australian growers to plant canola and lupins earlier than usual, to make the most of sub soil moisture.
Tenindewa farmer Glen Thomas is planting 6,690 hectares but says he is holding back on certain crops, like lupins, because of poor prices.
"We probably would have put even more in, given the summer rain. But we're just going to cap it at [1,000] where that's a big enough risk as it is," he said.

April rainfall sets Darwin record
The passage of tropical cyclone Monica in the Northern Territory has resulted in new rainfall levels.
Darwin has had its wettest April since falls records began 65 years ago.
A total of 383 millimetres has fallen so far this month and weather bureau forecaster Patrick Ward says that is close to four times the average.
"Darwin had about 53 mm at the airport, down towards Adelaide River it was a lot heavier. East branch Adelaide River had 224 mm, which is quite a lot," he said.
"This time of year it's sort of the clearing up period of the monsoon season and into the dry. It's unseasonably late to get a cyclone. It's just about the latest cyclone we have had."

'Smart card' introduction raises regional concerns
Concerns have been raised about potential logistical, cost and privacy problems in regional Australia with the introduction of a national identification card.
Federal Cabinet is today considering the so-called "smart card" which all Australian adults would need to access Medicare, welfare and tax benefits.
But independent federal MP for New England Tony Windsor says he has seen no evidence that the benefits would justify the expense.
"Well very, very costly of course for people who have got distance and remoteness to contend with," he said.
"What if there are technical problems, if that personal information is on a card and it is lost.
"We can see what computer fraud can do in accessing people's information.

Regional family day care operators fear for future
Family day care operators in many regional areas are worried they could be forced to reduce services or even close within months because of funding shortfalls.
The threat comes on top of a drop in available childcare places over the past year due to changes to funding.
Tracey Guerin from the Alice Springs Family Day Care Centre says the situation will get worse unless the federal Budget includes more financial support.
"I have grave concerns for the future of the service. I don't believe that we'll be funded to the same level as we have been and I think that we will either have to look at offering less of a service or closing all together," she said.

Investment schemes urged to stop new vineyard developments
Wine grape growers are urging investment schemes to put the brakes on new vineyard developments.
Peak body Wine Grape Growers Australia says money is still being put into the sector despite a massive oversupply of grapes.
Executive director Mark McKenzie says people should be wary about investing without a long term, secure contract for the fruit.
"It's not just independent grape growers or contracted, or uncontracted, grape growers who supply to wineries would be concerned," he said.

Newcastle shipment may provide new export opportunities
A live export shipment has left the port of Newcastle in New South Wales for the first time in years.
The ship, carrying 980 dairy cows, will arrive in Japan in a fortnight.
Cameron Hall from LiveCorp says it could be a new opportunity for the dairy sector in a state not known for live animal exports.

Aust to help improve Vietnamese industries
An Australian man has been appointed to help improve Vietnam's dairy and beef industries.
Vietnam's 25,000 dairy farmers have only four cows each on average.
Over the next five years, John Hopkins from Swan Hill will select 9,000 Australian cows for export to help boost herd numbers.
He will also help to establish a dairy training facility at the National Institute of Animal Husbandry in Saigon.
"They are really struggling with it and they are getting so many things wrong," he said.

Satellite tracking collars to track dingoes
Dingoes in southern and western Queensland are being fitted with satellite tracking collars.
The collars are part of a two year research project to help track and contain wild dog numbers.
Leigh Allen from the Department of Natural Resources and Mines says they have targeted three state forests near Roma, Dalby and Morven where baiting is not working.
"This is a research project to understand more about where dogs are coming from, how far they're moving and what the sources of the current problem are," she said.

Humans urged to adopt animal eating patterns
A study into the eating patterns of animals could help cut obesity rates in Western countries.
Left to choose their own food, research has shown animals will first seek out protein and never become obese.
In a natural state, the same is true for humans.
But Professor Steve Simpson from the University of Sydney says modern diets with high fat and salt contents trick people into overeating.
"But if you simply change the ratio and you can do that in one or two ways - incorporating high quality protein items in the diet and by that I mean lean meat or fish or high quality vegetable proteins," he said.

Upper Hunter stallion breaks stud fee record
A new Australian record for a stud fee has been set by the stallion Redoute's Choice.
The Arrowfield stud in the Upper Hunter of New South Wales has increased the champion stallion's service fee from $220,000 to $275,000.

Study spell trouble for single desk: Opposition
The Federal Opposition says the Government is carrying out a 'hatchet job' on the wheat export system by funding a study which it believes will call for the removal of the single desk.
Opposition agriculture spokesman Gavan O'Connor says grains industry think tank, Single Vision Australia, has commissioned a report into the single desk.
Single Vision is funded by the Government through the Grains Research and Development Corporation and has asked the Centre for International Economics to carry out research into the wheat export system.
And Mr O'Connor says that spells trouble for the single desk.
"It's the sort of organisation I think you employ when you want a hatchet job on the issue," he said.
The Government denies it had anything to do with setting up the report.
And Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says while the Government will consider its findings, it will not necessarily become policy.
"It will be an interesting read and whether or not it ever becomes public policy I wouldn't know," he said.
The report is due for release in the next few weeks.
Meanwhile hundreds of grain growers from across Western Australia have gathered in the wheatbelt town on Cunderdin to show support for the single desk.
Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile is also there to listen to farmers' concerns.
Brookton farmer Wanda Mattingly says WA growers want to send a clear message to Prime Minister John Howard that he needs to protect the current system.
"If we don't do something and then we sit back and whinge about it then we are our own worst enemies," he said.

Panel urges national approach to GM technology regulation
There is a call today for a national approach to the regulation of gene technology because of confusion caused by state-based bans on genetically modified (GM) crops.
The Gene Technology Act was introduced in 2000 to oversee the use of GM technology in Australia but since then all states except Queensland and the Northern Territory have imposed their own rules.
Chairwoman of an independent panel which has reviewed the Act, Susan Timbs, says the regulations have become too confusing.
"This was a point that was made very strongly to us by industry, that if they go through and get their approval from the regulator, suddenly they feel that there is a complete block because they don't know the criteria that they need to meet to convince the relevant state governments," she said.

Remote station may be nominated as alternative dump site
There is speculation in the Northern Territory that a remote cattle station could be nominated as an alternative site for a national nuclear waste dump.
Senator Nigel Scullion has intimated that Northern Land Council lands near Tennant Creek are being considered.
One of the few Aboriginal stations in the region is Muckaty on the edge of the Barkly Tableland.
Former station owner Miriam Hagan says while the area is drier than the proposed Top End site, she would still have grave concerns for the cattle country, if the rumour is true.
"I'm quite stunned actually and I do think it would be a profanity to put that on the beloved place where my sisters and I grew up," she said.
"There are, you know, deep underground aquifers, so I think a lot of homework would have to be done.

Hydro sale inquiry calls grow
Pressure is mounting on the New South Wales Government to hold a public inquiry into plans to privatise Snowy Hydro.
A big meeting of irrigators in southern New South Wales has called for legislation to guarantee their access to water.
The meeting of 200 irrigators in Griffith last night follows a fiery gatherting of 300 people in Cooma last week.
Irrigators are seeking a guarantee that minimum releases to the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers, covered by the Snowy water agreement, will be legislated.
They are also calling for a 10 per cent cap on individual shareholdings.
A former Snowy Hydro commissioner, Vin Good, urged people to oppose the sale.
"This Australian heritage icon should be kept in Government ownership forever," he said.
With harvest drawing to a close, up to 3 per cent of wine grapes will be left unpicked this year, due to oversupply.
The national vintage is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes, just 1 per cent down on last season.

Row brews over european bumblebees plan
A row has erupted over a plan to import european bumblebees to mainland Australia.
While the horticulture sector says they could help boost production in greenhouse and hydroponic operations, environmentalists are worried about other impacts.
A Department of Environment and Heritage report released for public comment last week is considering the importation of bumblebees for controlled crop pollination.
Queensland greenhouse tomato grower David Da Pra says it would dramatically boost production.
"Bring higher pollination, which will give better fruit quality, better shelf life, more saleable fruit," he said.
The Wide Bay Conservation Council's Pam Soper wants further research into artificial pollination, strongly opposing the importation of the bumblebee.

Resource boom behind zinc mine's reopening
The booming base metals price has led to the reopening of an old zinc mine in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.
Canadian company Teck Cominco will reopen its underground mine near Fitzroy Crossing because of a recent hike in zinc prices on the London Metal Exchange.
Teck Cominco exploration general manager Wayne Spilsbury says zinc is performing well after a three-year price glut.
"We were watching the stocks of zinc in the LME warehouses and making sure those numbers were coming down before we made a decision to reopen. There is now an under supply, but that has only turned up in the last year or so."
In South Australia, junior zinc explorer Terramin Australia has also benefited.

Pastoralists brush up on first aid
Some of the Northern Territory's most isolated pastoralists are in Tennant Creek to improve their medical skills today, amid concerns over the future of health services.
Station managers and workers from around the Northern Territory's Barkly Tablelands have travelled hundreds of kilometres to the central Australian town of Tennant Creek for the annual Barkly Health Seminar.
Heavy rain and boggy roads has done nothing to keep people away at a time of uncertainty about the future of remote health services in the region.
Pastoralists have expressed concern that visits by health experts to pastoral stations may soon be cut back.

Former station to provide haven for protected species
A former 63,000 hectare pastoral station in South Australia's north-east has been opened as a conservation park.
Boolcoomatta Station has been bought by the Federal Government and the Nature Foundation of South Australia to protect endangered bird life and flora.
Doug Humann from the Australian Bush Heritage Fund, which will manage the property, says it is a unique bioregion.
"It's a property that embraces vegetation systems and land types that are very poorly reserved in Australia," he said.
"It contains vulnerable species like the plains wanderer, a bird and we hope in future yellow footed rock wallabies.

Fruit fly find concerns growers
Fruit and vegetable producers on the Adelaide Plains are worried about the impact of a fruit fly outbreak.
Mediterranean fruit fly, which also targets vegetables, has been detected in Adelaide's north-west suburbs.
Mike Redmond, from the Virginia Horticulture Centre, north of the outbreak, says a quarantine area has been established and sterile flies are being released to contain the spread.
"If it got into our greenhouses it would be horrific for our industry," Mr Redmond said.
"Tomatoes, capsicums, eggplants would be the main impacts from our perspective.

Eucalyptus rust fears
The Primary Industries Ministerial Council meeting last week sounded an alarm call on the fungal disease, eucalyptus rust. The council noted the tree disease, native to South and Central America, had reached Hawaii, and there are fears it could get into Australia. Indeed the council went so far as to suggest that prevention and contingency plans for the disease be prepared as a matter of urgency. The disease attacks plants under two years of age, causing leaf and shoot dieback and killing the plant. Potentially it could kill not only large numbers of young plantation trees but also native eucalypts, as it has a wide number of eucalypts which could act as hosts. Ensis have predicted the areas most likely to be at risk are the NT, coastal Queensland and NSW. However, generally warmer conditions could see it easily colonise regions further south. In Brazil, there is a 40 per cent fatality from the disease.

Footrot control review
The continuation of the state's sheep footrot control program has been assured after a comprehensive review by representatives from the South Australian Sheep Advisory Committee, the South Australian Farmers Federation and PIRSA. In the 1950s, about one third of the sheep flocks in the south-east were suffering from the disease but eradication programs and improved diagnosis have eradicated the most virulent strains. Sheep with the disease find it difficult to walk and can get fly blown feet and legs from the disease, and they must be quarantined. Footrot is still a notifiable disease although new technologies would be trialed to find better control methods.

More work to be done on fresh produce code of conduct
The Federal Government denies it has broken a key election promise for a mandatory code of conduct for the fresh produce sector, despite further delays.
The code, to improve relations between wholesalers and growers, was to have been introduced within 100 days of the last election.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran now admits there is still more work to be done after Cabinet again failed to agree on the plan this week.
He also says statements by former deputy prime minister John Anderson that the code would include the big supermarket chains have been misinterpreted.
"I thought that was quite ambiguous and was a broadening out of his other statements that I've had regard to," he said.
"So it might have been in Mr Anderson's mind to expand it to supermarkets but that would have been policy on the run."
The National Farmers Federation says the Government's 100 day deadline was always unachievable.
Despite wanting the retail sector included originally, vice-president Charles Burke now just wants the policy in place as soon as possible.

Veg prices increase not flowing through to farmers
New figures show vegetables are costing 15 per cent more than at this time last year.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics says the cost of food overall jumped more than 4 per cent last quarter due to a hot summer and higher costs for inputs like fuel and packaging.
Mike Badcock from vegetable grower group AUSVEG says despite the rises, farmers are not seeing any increase in their profits.
"The very hot summer that eastern Australia experienced this year really affected production, it basically cooked the product in the ground and it wasn't suitable so there's been some quite large shortages of product - that's the reason prices have gone up," he said.
"The two major supermarket chains control about 76 per cent of the market, they've never had so much market share and they're becoming quite aggressive on what prices they pay for product.

Security tight for World Meat Congress
Animal rights campaigners have attempted to disrupt the World Meat Congress in Brisbane, where 600 delegates are discussing the future of the industry.
Protesters crying "murder" also say the Federal Government is sanctioning animal cruelty.
Security is tight at the World Meat Congress with police surrounding the Convention Centre in Brisbane and security guards everywhere inside the building.
The protest comes as Australia is experiencing unprecedented growth in the cattle and beef industry.
Cattle numbers are expected to grow by nearly 3 million head in the next four years and the value of exports has risen by $870 million since 2003, that's on the back of growth in Japan and Korea.
But keynote speaker at the Congress, Professor David Hughes, says while industry cannot ignore concerns about animal welfare, the total opposition to the farming of livestock represents a minority worldwide.

Murray River irrigators to sell water to Govt
The Federal Government will buy back water from Murray River irrigators to meet its targets for environmental flows.
Irrigators will be able to apply to sell water they have saved through improved on-farm infrastructure.
It is designed to help supply 500 gigalitres of water under the Living Murray Initiative.
Parliamentary Secretary for water policy Malcolm Turnbull says the tender process will be put forward at the next ministerial council meeting.

Oil-for-food inquiry adjourned
Apart from one last witness, public hearings at the oil-for-food inquiry are over.
Commissioner Terence Cole has formally adjourned the four month investigation.
Former UN customs official, Felicity Johnstone, will fly to Australia in mid-May to give evidence.

High Aussie dollar hurts farm profits
Economists say the rising Aussie dollar is cutting into farm returns.
The dollar has risen five cents over the past few days and overnight lifted above 75 US cents.
Westpac senior economist Justin Smirk says speculation over an interest rate rise next month has fuelled the increases.
But he says other factors are also having an impact.
"Commodity prices globally really haven't gone anywhere over the last 12 months or if anything perhaps have eased a bit," he said.
"So this strong Aussie dollar, of course, is crimping back our exporters income for the farmers and really when you are thinking about the farm sector - higher interest rates yes they will bite a bit around the margin.
"But perhaps the real significance is what we can't control and that is the rainfall out there and that is really going to be the driving factor of whether farmers have a good year or not."
The higher dollar and a large volume of wool has not helped the wool market, with sales resuming after the Easter recess.

Wool bale sold to fashion house for $63,000
The finest bale of wool ever offered in Australia has been sold for around $63,000.
The bale of 11.7 micron wool was sold by Ian and Kaye Appledore from Victoria's Wimmera region for 70,000 cents a kilogram to Italian fashion house, Lora Piana.
Ian Appledore is happy with the price, but says the bale was not the best they had to offer yesterday.
"11.7 [micron] wasn't our topline bale, our topline bale eventually sold as well once again to Lora Piana," he said.
"We sold that one for 48. The reason the 11.7 was our second line bale was it just didn't have the strength of the first one.

Tennant Creek residents oppose toxic dump
Residents of Tennant Creek in the Territory have rejected suggestions that a national toxic waste dump be built near the town.
Muckaty station just north of Tennant Creek has been identified as a possible site.
Three sites near Alice Springs and Katherine have been short-listed for the dump, but there is growing speculation that none of them will be chosen.

Vic Govt to challenge wind farm ban
The Victorian Government will take Federal Court action in a bid to overturn a decision to stop a wind farm development in south Gippsland.
Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell blocked the $220 million project because of a threat to the endangered orange bellied parrot.
While the State Government says the decision was unreasonable local farmer Don Jelbart believes it was the right one.
"They keep coming back to the parrot but there's 17 threatened species there," he said.

Adelaide River battles flooding
The Northern Territory community of Adelaide River is battling flooding in the wake of tropical cyclone Monica.
More than 150 millimetres of rain fell on Anzac Day alone this week.
Kai Hansen lives on Goat Island on the western edge of Kakadu National Park and says brown, crocodile-infested waters are roaring past his house.
"There is no dry land left at all. We knew this beforehand that there is a potential for it to come up here but 800mm of rain in one month, and 290mm of rain in 19 hours we had - it's an incredible amount of water," he said.
"I don't think we will see any crocs because as soon as water gets a bit rough the crocs seek quieter land.
"We don't worry about it, we walk around chest deep in the water now and then outside to salvage more things and get the boats and barges tied up and get to the generator shed, and we don't even consider it."

Councils seek to fill jobs through Melbourne advertising
A group of western Victorian councils have resorted to advertising in Melbourne newspapers to try to lure workers.
Ararat Rural City and the shires of Northern Grampians and Pyrenees will use ratepayer and state funds for the campaign, to address the skills shortage.
Ararat Council's rural development manager Mark Hogan says tradespeople, medical professionals and agricultural workers are all in short supply.
"The key area that made our mind up that this was the way we needed to go was some recent research from state and federal governments which showed that the number of people applying for jobs in our region and the Wimmera area is very small," he said.

Sterile fruit flies fail to satisfly partners
Sterile fruit flies have been touted as a way of controlling numbers of the pest insect but researchers say they are not proving to be satisfying mates.
Research has shown female fruit flies are attracted to the sterile males but they are not always satisfied and head off looking for other mates.
Dr Phil Taylor from Macquarie University says they are now trying to fix the problem, to stop them from causing major damage in horticultural regions.
"Wild flies don't seem to mind mating with them, however the sterile males have some issues with the amount of sperm they transfer and then the female's likely to re-mate," he said.

Studies to investigate GM crop issues
The Federal Government has placed further pressure on the states to lift their bans on genetically modified crops by announcing eight case studies into the sector's most contentious issues.
The studies will be done by the Bureau of Rural Sciences and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, and the private sector will contribute.
There will be four different reports on the impacts of releasing genetically modified canola, while weed control and the affect on organic farmers will also be considered.

Water trading available for southern Qld farmers
Queensland has given the go ahead for its first water trading scheme involving river systems.
Previously farmers could only buy water attached to land or from government-run irrigation schemes.
Water trading will now be introduced across the Moonie and Warrego catchments in southern Queensland.
An entitlement to access 120 megalitres a day from the Moonie River will be auctioned next month and Clayton Smith from Elders believes it could sell for well over $2 million.
"Existing irrigators will be keen to get more water to do more development on their properties and secure their future," he said.

Mini turbine generates farm power
A Victorian dairy farmer has invented a mini hydroelectric turbine to generate on-farm power.
The Sundermann turbine, named after farmer Fred Sundermann, can be used in slow-moving water, like irrigation channels and streams.
It is about the size of a large washing machine and is designed to generate power in remote areas.
Mr Sundermann says he hopes his turbine can be used to power remote communities around the world.
"I have dreams for the turbine," he said.

Roo shooter numbers may threaten industry
There is concern a record number of kangaroo shooters in Queensland is threatening the industry's future.
Up to 2,000 shooters are registered in Queensland, with 400 new licences granted since October alone.
Jeffrey Newton from the Macropod and Wild Game Harvesters Association says record roo meat prices mean too many people are vying for a share of already limited quotas.
"As with any industry, big dollars attract people that are chasing that quick dollar but unfortunately this industry can't sustain that," he said.

Water in the bank
While water scarcity is not much of an issue in the Top End at the moment, in central Australia attempts to develop a new horticulture industry depend very much on new water saving technology. The water re-use project in Alice Springs has been under development for some time but emerging technology could make a number of similar projects viable and workable. Professor Stuart White from Sydney's University of Technology has worked on water saving projects with governments and councils around Australia and he says there is a new sense of urgency to develop water savings projects. "When we start to move away from the urban sector and talk about water use more generally and remember 80 per cent of water is not used in towns and cities it's actually used in irrigated agriculture and so on, we do have to take a bit of a long hard look at some of the industries that are using water and say is this appropriate and what is the trade off between the impact of some of these industries and the impact on water ways and the benefit we derive from them. However there is huge scope for efficiency there, I mean we're talking about efficiency levels which can be improved even beyond what we're talking about in the cities, in terms of relatively low cost savings, and some of those are starting to be picked up and that's a good thing."

Crop planting to follow weekend rain
Despite the high diesel prices, crop planting is expected to get into full swing across much of Victoria and South Australia this week after good weekend rain.
Most of South Australia's growing areas had rain and there were also falls of between 44 and 30 millimetres across northern Victoria.
Victorian talkback caller Shirley is certainly relieved.
"We've had 51 millimetres. We had one of those scattered thunderstorms. We were actually away for the day and we got home here at about 6:00pm and the further we came towards home, there was more water and we got home and there was just water everywhere," she said.

AWB delegation to investigate wheat pesticide find
A 50,000 tonne shipment of Australian wheat has been stopped from unloading in India after tests revealed unacceptable levels of pesticide.
The shipment, which left the port of Adelaide last week, is now on standby at Chennai port, awaiting further testing from Indian and Australian authorities.
It is the first consignment of a half million tonne tender won by exporter AWB and spokesman Peter McBride says the company is sending its own delegation.
"They have identified that there is a high level of pesticide reading, so AWB is sending a high level delegation to India which will leave today to meet with our customers to address the issue and obtain more information," he said.
"We've run tests here as the ships leave and we'll do that for future vessels.
"We can't really provide further details until we have met with our customers and hopefully we'll have further information later this week or early next week."

Trucking companies to pass on increased fuel costs
The transport industry will start passing on the increased cost of fuel this week as companies begin to include fuel surcharges in contracts.
The Australian Trucking Association (ATA) has been urging operators to act for some time, especially smaller businesses who are struggling to absorb the higher diesel costs.
The ATA's Stuart St Clair says he is relieved at the industry's decision and believes most customers have been expecting it.
"I think the majority of customers would understand because they'd be under some similar price pressures themselves, particularly those that have a lot of vehicles on the road, whether they be stock and station agents or whether they be farmers or others," he said.

New dam plan angers farmers
Farmers are angry over plans for a big new dam in south-east Queensland.
Landholders near Gympie are planning a campaign to try to force the State Government to scrap the idea, which involves the resumption of 900 properties.
The dam is designed to fix the water crisis in the south-east corner of Queensland and will cover 7,500 hectares of prime farm land near Traveston Crossing on the Mary River.
One of the region's biggest dairy producers, John Cochrane, has just spent a million dollars upgrading his farm, which would end up 30 metres underwater.

Ginseng managed investment scheme wound up
Tasmania's ginseng managed investment scheme will be wound up, with a $5 million loss.
There were hopes the scheme could be salvaged but they have been dashed by the poor performance of the ginseng farm near Richmond, in the state's south.

Buderim Ginger's domestic sales drop 6pc
Queensland-based Buderim Ginger says the major supermarket's push towards home brands has resulted in its first drop in domestic sales in 15 years.
The company has announced a profit of $536,000 for last year, up 56 per cent.
Exports have grown 10 per cent but chairman John Ruscoe says domestic sales have fallen away by 6 per cent.
"The retailers are clearly trying to position their own house brands where they can at the most desirable places in the store, which means that our products really are competing with that," he said.

Wet season takes its toll on live cattle exports
The Northern Territory's protracted wet season is having a lasting impact on live cattle exports to South-East Asia.
Feedlots in Australia's largest market, Indonesia, are less than half-full, with another 50,000 cattle needed.
Stuart Kenny from the Territory Cattlemen's Association says cattle prices in Indonesia have gone up but that has not slowed demand.
"There has been more price rises over the last couple of weeks but our visitors are saying that the prices did not detract from the supply and that's a good sign," he said.
"I think the Indonesian economy is certainly sort of holding its own and we certainly look forward to seeing a good cattle season ahead for the NT cattle industry.

Table grape exports resume to Indonesia
Table grape exporters have resumed trade with Indonesia after being shut out of the market last month.
Indonesia has imposed tough new quarantine protocols to reduce the threat of fruit fly, which the industry has branded unworkable.
Some companies have begun fumigating fruit with methyl bromide at a Melbourne facility to meet the new demands but Brett Pickering from exporter Best Fresh says it is not an ideal result.
"There is an additional cost obviously for the treatment," he said.
"In terms of shipping out of the country we lose a bit of flexibility in being able to utilise the Adelaide port for later leaving vessels.

WA native title battle resolved
A 12-year native title battle surrounding the Western Australian town of Broome has finally been resolved.
The Federal Court has recognised the Yawuru people as the rightful native title holders of land surrounding Broome.
The full effect of native title will take place on the Indigenous-owned cattle property, Roebuck Station, while the neighbouring property, Thangoo Station, will continue to operate as a privately-owned lease.
Fred Chaney from the Native Title Tribunal says the decision also extends to areas like the famous Cable Beach.
"The beach is of course a very significant feature of Broome and that is an area where you can't have exclusive possession the court found but where the Aboriginal people have continuing traditional interests which they share with the general community," he said.
"There are areas of town where native title has been found to survive (in other words not extinguished) and there are very large areas outside town, in particular the Aboriginal owned pastoral property which has exclusive possession native title."

Pilbara pastoral strike anniversary remembered
Indigenous people in Western Australia's north-west are commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Pilbara pastoral strike.
Aboriginal pastoral workers walked off stations on May 1, 1946, demanding wages and better conditions.
Fran Heintz from the Wanga Maya Aboriginal Language Centre says the event had a massive impact on Indigenous workers.
"It's been a fairly significant event for the region and in many ways we believe it's a significant national event," he said.
"Some people actually call it the black Eureka. It did set what's been in place now for 60 years and that is the equal respect.

Cattlemen unable to find murdered teen
Cattlemen in Victoria's Barmah forest have been unable to assist police in finding a murdered teenager missing since April last year.
Detectives asked the cattlemen to keep an eye out during their annual muster at the weekend.
Raymond Allen, 17, from Mooroopna, is believed to have been killed and buried in the forest on the banks on the Murray River.
But Kelvin Trickey from the Barmah Cattlemen's Association says nothing was found.
"We haven't detected anything at all ... we're always tracking for cattle, looking for foot marks and that all through the bush," he said.

Parade heralds start to mustering season
The main streets of Alice Springs are closed today to pay tribute to the local cattle industry.
The Bangtail parade celebrates the traditional start to the central Australian mustering season.
Historically the May Day weekend was when cattle from stations around Alice Springs were marched through the streets to the year's first sale.
Today there are no cattle in sight but the Alice Springs mayor will lead the parade watched by about 5,000 people as it makes its way through the centre of the town.
But while Alice Springs is a hive of activity, it is somewhat more quiet on the stations.

Athletic mare takes out campdraft comp
An athletic mare called Roanys Chex, ridden by central Queenslander Pete Comiskey, has taken out Australia's richest campdraft at Rockhampton.
Record numbers of riders competed over the weekend in front of what organisers say was its biggest ever crowd.
Mr Comiskey says his $20,000 share of the prizemoney will come in handy.
"Most certainly there's always plenty of costs in campdrafting," he said.
"It's always a great honour to win the big one and this mare has been very successful for us, to win the clock last year and the Gold cup, and we're very lucky to have her on the truck."

Skilled migrants' minimum wage may hurt business
Meat processors say the Federal Government's decision to set a new minimum wage for temporary migrant workers will hurt regional businesses.
Workers on temporary visas will have to be paid a minimum of $42,000 a year after unions claimed local jobs were being undercut.
The Federal Government says the decision is to help Australia compete against other nations in the fight to attract employees.
Kevin Cottrill from the Meat Industry Council says while it will not stop employers from taking on migrant workers, it will add to costs.
"The big risk I guess is that the expectation of current employees and of unions is that there might be a 7 per cent increase across the board in wages, that would be the big danger," he said.
"We're looking at something in excess of 7 per cent which is a substantial increase given the current rates of inflation so it will certainly have an affect on the costs of the industry."

Rural students sought to fill mining job vacancies
The education sector in South Australia will recruit students from rural areas to meet the needs of the state's mining boom.
With concerns over future labour shortages, a new degree in mining engineering will be offered at the University of Adelaide next year.
Inaugural Professor of Mining Geology, Ian Plimer, says the new course will specifically seek students from outside the city.
"We are really targeting students from the rural areas because the mining takes place in the rural areas," he said.

Animal rights group targets children in education campaign
An animal rights group has announced plans to target 3 million children in 9,000 schools with a program it says teaches compassion and respect for animals.
Voiceless has launched its Animal Club project on the Internet, encouraging children to speak out against factory farming, live exports, and kangaroo culling.
Education Manager Elaine Morris, says it is the first national animal education initiative for children.
"All Animal Club really wants to do is just provide children with the opportunity to harness that natural empathy that most children have for animals, and look at them through a child's eyes," she said.

Blueprint targets strategies to combat rural suicides
The Federal Government has been presented with a blueprint outlining 23 ways to ease the mental health crisis in regional Australia.
The release of the blueprint marks the launch of the Rural Mental Health Network, a partnership of 19 stakeholders from New South Wales.
The Rural Mental Health Network includes mental health support groups, charity organisations, government departments and farming representatives
The network says male farmer deaths from suicide are double that of any other group in the population and is urging governments to take action saying the drought may end, but ramifications such as depression and financial hardship continue for many years.

Farmer confidence falls as oil prices rise
High oil prices and rising Australian dollar have hurt confidence levels among farmers.
The National Australia Bank's agribusiness monitor shows more farmers reported poor conditions in the March quarter than in the December quarter, although they are generally optimistic about the longer term.

Machinery demand falls in wake of low grain prices
Low grain prices are being blamed for a big drop off in demand for broadacre tractors and machinery over the past 12 months.
Sales are booming in the sugar, dairy and horticulture sectors for smaller equipment, but Vin Delahunty from the Tractor and Machinery Association says grain farmers are holding off.
"People who are relying on sales into the cropping areas have really struggled," she said.

Canola growers may benefit from high oil price
The high price of crude oil is causing plenty of headaches, but there could be a positive spin-off for canola growers.
European countries and the US are focusing more attention on alternative ways of producing power.
David Syme from the Grain Pool in Western Australia says they will be looking for more canola.
Particularly in Germany, there's quite a number of new biodiesel plants going up, and that's of course consuming a lot of their rapeseed oil," he said.

Fertiliser supplier's half-year profit rises
Fertiliser supplier Incitec Pivot has reported a turnaround, posting a half-year profit of more than $27 million up nearly 60 per cent on last year.
The company says it is a result of a restructure and high fertiliser prices.

Climate change may shift Goyder's Line
Climate change could force South Australia's iconic Goyder's Line to shift 100 kilometres south.
The imaginary line was drawn in 19th century by surveyor general George Goyder marking the 250 millimetre rainfall area from the Eyre Peninsula around to the Riverland.
He believed the region north of the line should not be cropped.
Peter Hayman from the South Australian Research and Development Institute says with an increase in temperature and a reduction in rainfall, the line could shift as far south as the Clare Valley.
"What we found was that the worst scenario, so the worst amount of warming and the most extreme scenario was for it to move by 2070 as far as as somewhere like Clare," he said.

Turnbull hears river flow worries
The Parliamentary Secretary responsible for water, Malcolm Turnbull, has entered the debate over cross-border water flows in the Condamine Balonne river system.
Landholders in north-western New South Wales have long complained they are missing out because Queensland irrigators are allegedly extracting too much water north of the border.
Mr Turnbull met landholders yesterday and says while the Federal Government cannot force Queensland to change its water management policy, the problem must be addressed.
"There is no question in my mind that when the allocations of water were made in Queensland over the last 2O to 30 years, little or no regard was had to the downstream consequences in New South Wales," he said.

Dam compo discussions too early, says minister
The Queensland Government says it is too early to discuss compensation for farmers affected by a proposed new dam near Gympie, in the state's south-east.
The Government is planning to build a 660,000 megalitre dam on the Mary River, which would involve the resumption of 900 properties.
But Water Minister Henry Palaszczuk says it will be a number of weeks before the Government decides if it will definitely go ahead with the plan.
"Currently it's under investigation but if the numbers stack up, of course that will become the site," he said.

Commercial beekeepers close up shop
The commercial beekeeping industry in the Northern Territory has decided to call it a day.
After the poorest season in memory involving floods, termites, cane toads and a depressed honey market, Kevin Eastburn from the NT Beekeepers' Association says they simply cannot continue.
He says his greatest concern at this point is what the decision will mean for other industries, which rely on local bees for pollination.

Pearl farm purchase 'positive sign for industry'
There are changes under way in Australia's pearling industry, with a major distributor and marketing company buying its first pearl farm.
The Autore group has paid $15 million for Broome-based Clipper Pearls.
Brett McCallum from the Pearl Producers Association says after a tough few years in the sector, the deal has injected a bit of confidence in the sector.
"I think that someone like Autore who is as close to the market and as close to the pearling world as he is, has obviously got great confidence in investing a significant amount of money in this industry," he said.

Tokyo restaurant to use Victorian produce
The Bracks Government is backing a restaurant in Tokyo, which will offer food made entirely from Victorian produce.
Locally-grown beef, lettuce and olive oil will be among the ingredients on the menu at Hiroo 148.
Ross Clarke from the Department of Primary Industries says it is designed to help producers overcome communication problems with Japanese distributors.
"When you put a new product into the Japanese market it takes some time to develop a supply chain," he said.
"Translation is a real issue and communicating with importers about your product.

Beef brand celebrates program benefits
The benefits of marketing food from paddock to plate are being marked by the 10th birthday of one of Australia's biggest beef brands.
Certified Australian Angus Beef began by supplying 12 steers for a Melbourne restaurant.
It now kills 2,000 head of cattle a week, with 80 per cent of the product exported.
Chief executive Michael Pointer says the program has added vale to the product and boosted demand for angus genetics.
"Very simply Certified Australian Angus Beef does not own an animal or a kilogram of beef," he said.

Results of sheep pesticide review still some time away
It will be several months before a report into the health effects of a common sheep pesticide are made public.
The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority is conducting a review into diazinon, which is used to treat lice and flystrike in sheep, after its use caused serious health concerns for some rural workers.

Tests clear Australian wheat shipment
Authorities in India have now cleared a shipment of Australian wheat, just two days after claiming it contained an unacceptable level of pesticide.
A second round of tests has found no contamination in the 50,000 tonne consignment, which is being unloaded at the port of Chennai.
AWB's Peter McBride says the company is not yet sure what caused the mix-up.
"AWB has been officially informed that the wheat has been fully cleared by Indian authorities and the shipment is currently unloading at Chennai in India," he said.
"We had some meetings late yesterday, we'll obviously have further meetings today but the good news is the wheat has been cleared."

Rates hike to hurt commodities outlook
The Reserve Bank's decision to lift interest rates is more bad news for farmers, following on from high fuel prices.
The interest rate rise, to 5.75 per cent, is the first in more than 14 months.
Senior analyst with Hartleys, Rob Brierley, says the announcement will hurt the outlook for commodities.
"Most of the commodities are priced in US dollars so it means that the seller of the commodity actually gets less in Australian dollars for it," he said.

Farmers dispute Govt report figures
Vegetable growers say the Federal Government has made up figures in a report, which shows extended country of origin food labelling would cost consumers $120 million a year.
Farmers want the labels on packaged and canned food as well as fresh produce to give consumers more information and promote locally grown fruit and vegetables.
But the Government says the study shows the costs of the changes would far outweigh the benefits for both consumers and growers.
John Roach from grower group AusVeg says the study was based on flawed data.
But while rejecting new laws to enforce more detailed labels, Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says he wants to change the Trade Practices Act to give consumers more accurate information.
He says under the changes, 'made in Australia' would be replaced for some packaged food to 'grown in Australia'.

Fruit growers attend crisis summit
Australia's summerfruit industry is drafting an action plan to try to keep producers in business.
Peach, nectarine, plum, apricot and apple growers are battling cheap imports and a lack of export sales since access to Taiwan was restricted last season.
Fruit growers are still thrashing out the details at a crisis summit in Melbourne, but Heather Chong from Summerfruit Australia says some priorities are emerging.

Wool pool to help Tas growers
In a departure from the traditional auction system, wool growers in Tasmania will be able to sell their fibre through a new wool pool.
Agribusiness Roberts Limited has launched Wool Link to market Tasmanian grown and branded wool direct to the fashion houses of Japan and the US.
Ten thousand bales will be sold in the first year, and the company says growers will be paid more than they have received on average in the auction rooms.
Marketing manager Eric Hutchinson admits there is bound to be scepticism.
"And for some it's going to be a leap of faith in what we can deliver, there's no doubt about that," he said.

US producers implement animal ID system
US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns says major beef buyers have given the country little choice but to implement a national animal ID system.
The National Animal Identification System could become compulsory if not enough US producers volunteer to join by 2009.
Mr Johanns says in response to industry opponents of animal ID in US, major beef competitors Australia and Canada have already implemented systems to trace and contain disease outbreaks.
And most recently, Mr Johanns cited retail demand in Australia.
"I just noticed that in Australia, a representative of McDonalds, which of course is a major purchaser of beef, made a statement about the need for this animal ID system."
Mr Johanns predicted the US industry will have to change with the times, despite some who oppose new costs and less corporate privacy.

Restraint boxes to improve cattle slaughter in SE Asia
Australia is investing almost a million dollars to improve the slaughter of cattle in South-East Asia.
Fifty restraint boxes are being installed at abattoirs across Indonesia and Malaysia.
The aim is to ensure all Australian cattle are processed humanely within two years.
Meat and Livestock Australia's Patrick Underwood says he is confident the boxes will be used.
"It's a fully galvanised and enclosed box, whereby the animal enters through a raceway into an abattoir, is placed in a restraining box and restrained prior to slaughter," he said.
"I have formed an animal welfare task force, with members of APFINDO (the Indonesian feedlotters and farmers association), so the Indonesian importers are with us, illustrating the clear benefits of using these restraining boxes."

Beef Australia under way in Rockhampton
Australia's biggest beef industry event is under way in central Queensland.
Rockhampton hosts Beef Australia every three years, claiming it is the country's beef capital.
Fifty thousand people are in the city and over 200 head of stud cattle from 34 breeds, making it one of the largest displays in one place in one time in the world.
And the world is in Rockhampton - 450 delegates from 27 countries including Argentina, Indonesia and China.
It is not all conferences and seminars though. The Iron Man and Woman event will see competitors eat marinated bulls testicles and there's a great debate, is beef better than sex?

Decision to abandon water transport plan 'not surprising'
Residents of Western Australia's far north say they are relieved at a decision to abandon plans to transport Kimberley water to Perth.
Three options were investigated by the State Government, involving a water pipeline, a canal or transport by sea.
None have been found to be economically viable.
Kununurra resident Dick Pasfield says he is not surprised,
"I think there was a reasonable amount of scepticism about whether a project like this would actually be viable in terms of the economics," he said.
"I guess that what the report has said is basically what a lot of people thought in the first place, that it's going to cost far too much money to do a project like this."
The WA government is still on the hunt for alternate water sources, looking at options including the Yarragadee aquifer in the state's south-west.

Aboriginal corporation fined for neglecting cattle
An Aboriginal corporation in Western Australia has been fined $10,000 for failing to provide sufficient water for 1,500 head of cattle on a station in the state's interior.
The fine was handed down yesterday after the Windidda Aboriginal Corporation pleaded guilty to the charge brought by the RSPCA.
Tim Darcy from the Pastoralists and Graziers Association says it is important that livestock producers from across Australia stick to animal welfare standards.

Dry conditions take their toll in NSW
Dry conditions are continuing to hurt in New South Wales, where producers in the Upper Hunter are being knocked back from grazing cattle on the travelling stock routes.
A lack of water is being blamed for the situation in Singleton, Scone and Merriwa, where some producers are waiting up to 12 months to access reserves.
Scone ranger Gerard McLaughlin says he does not have a choice, with half the watering points in his area dry.
"There's 590 head at the moment wandering around the roads in my area ... there could probably be a lot more if we had water that's the problem," he said.
"At the moment I'm getting more and more requests for people wanting to go on the road but it's a bit awkward when you can't access water."

Farmers battle fleabane
Farmers in Western Australia are battling a nightmare weed which can take over paddocks and is difficult to kill.
The area affected by fleabane on the south coast is increasing rapidly, with the tall woody plant also spreading into agricultural areas further north.
Dr Sally Peltzer from the state Department of Agriculture and Food says good summer rainfall has made the problem worse.
"I've been out and about actually trying to collect a bit of fleabane and I have seen some pretty nasty paddocks," she said.
"It looks worse because they're sort of tall and hairy looking so that doesn't tend to look, compared to the other, pasture plants or whatever."

Govt holiday workers scheme to be extended
A scheme to use backpackers to ease labour shortages in the horticulture and cropping sectors is being extended to cover livestock, forestry and fishing.
From July, holiday makers who work for three months in jobs like shearing, stock handling and pearling will be able to apply for a second 12 month visa.
The Federal Government will also double the length of time backpackers can work for one employer - from three to six months.
The National Farmers Federation's Denita Wawn says producers would prefer to employ local workers but there are not enough people willing to work in regional Australia.
"At NFF certainly it is our preference that we can [use] locals to work in these jobs but experience shows that people, a lot of people simply aren't interested in working in agriculture," she said.
But some primary industries are highly critical of the changes.
The Territory's pearling industry says the increase to six month work placements will not solve labour shortages, because that's still not long enough to cover the cost of induction and training.
The Horticultural Association says the extension will benefit the nursery, pruning and packing industries but spokeswoman Tracey Leo says there could be a big impact on the mango harvest.
"We are seeing a thinning of the available labour pool. So in short I guess we are now going into competition with industries that we may not have been competing for labour with before," she said.
"In our high volume years, they [foreign workers] are a significant portion of our labour force.

Failure to reach trade deal could delay Doha talks: Vaile
Despite missing a crucial deadline in global negotiations to reduce trade distorting tariffs and subsidies in agriculture, Trade Minister Mark Vaile says a deal can be reached this year.
Mr Vaile flew back into Australia this morning after talks in Europe and says the European Union is now looking at further reductions in the financial support it gives to farmers.
But he is warning a failure to get a deal this year, could delay the Doha Round of talks until 2011.
"That is the great unknown because once we go beyond the northern summer which is fundamentally August, the farm Bill has to be renewed and there's already pressure coming on in Congress in Washington to start writing a new farm Bill," he said.

Govt urged to help pay-off wool debt
The wool industry has made a united call on the Federal Government to help pay a $27 million debt owed by its marketing arm, Australian Wool Services (AWS).
AWS has been responsible for a UK-based superannuation fund for former employees since privatisation in 2000, which is costing the company more than $1.2 million a year.
The debt is holding up any possibility of a merger with research group, Australian Wool Innovation.
AWS chairman Barry Walker hopes industry delegates will meet with Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran within weeks.
"We've been trying now for some 20 months with the Government to get this on the agenda and to get recognition of the issue," he said.

Poppy processor slashes prices
The poppy industry has taken another hit, with processor Tasmanian Alkaloids slashing prices to growers by 17 per cent.
Two weeks ago Tasmania's other processor, GlaxomSmithKline cut its crop area by 90 per cent.
Lyndley Chopping from the Tasmanian Poppy Growers Association says the latest price cut cannot be supported.
"We cannot recommend the prices to the growers and we're not recommending the prices to the growers," he said.
"We feel as though the company is taking advantage of the situation.
"We're very upset with the result of this. So the growers do their figures as to whether they grow again or whether they give the land a spell, or whether they go into another crop or another enterprise. That's their call."

Snowy Hydro inquiry won't delay sale
The New South Wales Government says plans to privatise Snowy Hydro will not be delayed by a parliamentary inquiry into the sale.
A New South Wales Upper House committee made up of Government, Opposition and cross bench members will investigate concerns about the privatisation.
The inquiry is due to report back in late October, although the State Government says the sale will proceed by the middle of the year.
Opposition natural resources spokesman Adrian Piccoli denies it is too late to make a difference.

Minister launches wind farm discussion paper
The Federal Government is investigating a national code for wind farm developments, to try to stop conflict in rural communities.
The Government is embroiled in a legal stoush with Victoria, after overturning approval for a major new wind farm in Gippsland in order to save the endangered orange-bellied parrot.
Environment Minister Ian Campbell has launched a discussion paper on the proposed code, which he says may be the best way of resolving disputes.

Vic juice grade apples can't find buyers
Cartons of juice grade apples are being left in Victorian packing sheds this harvest.
Growers say they are being offered an opening price of $55 a tonne, which is not enough to cover freighting and picking costs.
Beechworth grower Rob Tully says there is added frustration from city-based juice bars, which will only take a-grade fruit.
"Even the juice bars though, are very quality conscious and although they're only making juice fruit they're fairly conscious if the fruit has too many marks on it," he said.

WA potato farmers battle watery conditions
Waterlogged crops are making harvest difficult for the second year in a row for seed potato producers on WA's south coast.
Potatoes from the Albany area usually contribute between $3 million and $4 million to the state's $10 million industry, which exports to South-East Asia and Mauritius.
But wet summer and autumn conditions have halted mechanical harvesting, and Terry Ackley from the WA Potato Growers Association says spuds are rotting in the ground.
"Swamps were still very wet from the last season and we never really had a hot, dry summer to dry them completely," he said.
"And of course this rain has been devastating again.

Agfest crowds brave the Tassie cold
It has been a chilly start to Tasmania's annual rural field days, Agfest, in the state's north.
Coffee sales are up but farm machinery sales are expected to be down.
Querkus Park is a sea of tents, marquees and pavilions, and with an early taste of winter chills, stalls with heaters are proving very popular today.
Agfest is the major gathering for rural industries with more than 700 exhibitors and sales are seen as a barometer of the state's rural industries.
This year, sales are expected to reflect the contract cuts in the poppy and vegetable industries.
The bright spot though is the buoyant dairy industry.

Lamb sales to Japan booming
Sales of Aussie lamb into Japan are booming, with annual growth rates of up to 70 per cent.
Japanese importer Top Trader says lamb is losing its reputation as an unpleasant smelly meat and the market is set to grow, despite looming competition from US beef.
And the good times are set to continue.
Meat and Livestock Australia's Malcolm Harvey says Russia is emerging as the next big market for lamb.
"It's not subject to any quotas, the amount of money and wealth being generated in Russia is just something that's hard for people to comprehend, and they love Australian lamb," he said.

Competition hots up at Beef 2006
It is another huge day at Beef 2006 in Rockhampton in central Queensland.
There is very serious business taking place, amid the trade fair rodeos and the sinking of a few ales.
It is the biggest stud beef cattle ever held in Australia with over 30 breeds on show.
The prime cattle competition was won by Ken McKenzie of Yaralla, near Blackwater in central Queensland.

Farmers wary of govt changes to fuel rebates
Farmers already fighting higher interest rates and the strong Aussie dollar now face changes to their fuel bills from July 1, which could add further pressure to their budgets.
The Federal Government will scrap a tax subsidy rebate worth up to three cents a litre to regional motorists, and change the 18-cent a litre on-road energy credit scheme.
Under the scheme, farmers and transport operators will receive their fuel rebate off their GST bills, instead of a cash grant paid directly into their bank accounts.
Luke Fraser from the Livestock Transporters Association says the changes will create a cash flow headache for rural and regional businesses.
"We have a business where over 30 per cent of our total cost input is fuel. Farmers would probably understand that sentiment," he said.
"And in that sort of position, when you're being asked to go through administrative hoops to try and claim that back, and you never actually see it in cash, it's just coming off a tax bill, well that's a big change.
"To say, look on July 1 it's all going to switch over and everyone will be fine, is incredibly naive and insulting."
A spokesman for Assistant Treasurer Peter Dutton says it will be simpler in the long run to deliver the energy credit to farmers and truckers through their GST bills.

Aileron residents don sombreros for Mexican mutton chase
It is not often you see Mexicans swilling tequila and riding donkeys in central Australia.
But this weekend at the bush carnival at Aileron, 130km north of Alice Springs, you had better be prepared to don a sombrero.
While the adults gulp down beans and tequila and race donkeys, organiser Sarah Debney says it is sheep that people really want to see.
"That's the Mexican mutton chase...we've got teams of two children and the team puts on their ponchos and hats and they run down the other end and do the same scull with water and baked beans, run back and we let sheep out of the shoots and they have to herd the sheep over the line," she said.

Crowds flock to Broken Hill for Agfair
The far western New South Wales city of Broken Hill is packed to capacity today, for the area's biggest biennial event.
There is not a spare motel room available in Broken Hill this weekend as swarms of people have converged into the city to celebrate Agfair.
Three hundred exhibitors are on show slightly down on two years ago, as organisers claim high petrol prices have discouraged some from travelling the distance.

Exchange rates hit wool market
Rising exchange rates and high pass-in rates have hit the wool market again this week.
The eastern market indicator dropped off 6 per cent, to finish the week at 708 cents a kilogram clean.
Prices are 46 cents lower than the season high in March.
Among the offerings were 1,700 bales offered by the New Zealand Merino Company.
A whopping 41.6 per cent were passed in.

Beef program adds to producer returns
A new economic analysis has found the beef quality program MSA is adding an extra 20 cents a kilo to beef producers' returns.
The meat standard was developed by the Beef Cooperative Research Centre and uses a set of scientific criteria to allow consumers to identify beef which is guaranteed to be tender.
Centre head Dr Heather Burrow says the program will add $85 million to beef revenue this financial year.
Overall, she says it has generated three times what it cost to industry to develop.
"Averaging 20 cents a kilo, beef producers, retailers and processors are getting a premium for beef that they can guarantee is better than every day eating quality," she said.
The Bureau of Statistics will conduct a census of livestock producers for the first time in five years.
It will collect data from 190,000 farms across the country and is expected to highlight the value of the cattle industry to the Australian economy.
Census manager, Jim Williamson says the data will help to drive the live export industry.
"Being able to ensure we can meet future export markets if we want to enter into future contracts, we can be confident we have enough cattle to fill the contracts," he said.
"People can keep a handle on whether the cattle herd is going up or down."

Primary producers frustrated at lack of harvest labour support
Primary producers in Western Australia are disappointed at missing out on harvest labour support.
The Federal Government will fund services in 16 harvest areas across Australia, but says tenders from the west were not up to scratch.
The services help to match the pool of workers with seasonal job vacancies.
David McKerrell from the Kimberley Primary Industries Association says it is frustrating funds have not made it to all regions
"It needs to be recognised that there are production areas right across Australia that have a requirement for harvest labour and all areas should be given opportunity to take part in those sort of schemes," he said.

Maritime protected area boundaries to be announced
The Federal Government will this afternoon announce the final boundaries for marine protected areas off the Tasmanian, Victorian and South Australian coasts.
They are expected to be significantly different to the Government's initial proposal, which drew criticism from the fishing and scallop industries for being too strict.
The Tasmanian scallop sector said it would be wiped out if the areas were enforced.

Poppy processor defends price cut
Poppy processor, Tasmanian Alkaloids says its latest price cuts will not be a disaster for Tasmanian growers.
The company will slash prices for the coming crop by 17 per cent, although it plans to double the size of its supply contracts.
The Poppy Growers Association says the price cut can not be supported, but Rick Rockliff from Tasmanian Alkaloids says higher yielding varieties and a better season should help farmers to improve their profits.
"We feel confident that if growers pay attention to detail and follow their field officers' advice, given a more normal season, we're pretty confident that growes will have substantially more money in their bank accounts this time next year," he said.

NFF calls for schools to examine interest groups
The National Farmers Federation is calling on governments to ban special interest groups from unvetted entry to school classrooms.
Animal rights group Voiceless has launched a web-based education program which offers prizes for the most humane school and encourages children to speak out about factory farming, kangaroo culling and live exports.
NFF president Peter Corrish says the website has links to extreme animal rights groups.
"What we're saying is the principals of each school and certainly the parents of the children involved need to have a look at this website and actually go to these links and see what information their children may be accessing," he said.

Shareholders expected to launch class action against AWB
A class action by shareholders against monopoly wheat exporter AWB is expected within weeks.
Investors will seek compensation from AWB, alleging the company did not report its activities truthfully.
The Cole Inquiry has spent the past four months investigating AWB's actions under the oil for food program in Iraq.
Ben Slade from Maurice Blackburn Cashman, says the class action will raise a number of issues.
"The most extraordinary positive act of misleading conduct we think is October 27 when the company issued a statement to the stock exchange after the Volcker suggestion was made in 2005 that the company may have been involved in sanctions busting," he said.
"The company made a statement to the stock exchange that it was not. Well that's another course of action that is even more powerful."
AWB shares have defied stockmarket trends to gain ground this week, despite the Reserve Bank's decision to lift interest rates.
AWB stocks fell considerably during the Cole inquiry, but yesterday gained 5 per cent.
Stockbrocker Matthew Baker says the prospect of more trade with India is behind the gains.
"But basically AWB has got on with its job and it's gone out there and it looks like it's going to win more business in India which is basically ship more product out the door," he said.
"Their price will vary because of the currency side but they're happy because they're going to be selling a lot more stock."
The Indian Government is expected to announce a tender for 3 million tonnes of wheat within a week.
Soaring domestic prices and a lower than expected crop are putting pressure on Indian authorities to provide enough wheat for the population.

Milk, cheese, yoghurt prices to rise
On top of petrol hikes and higher interest rates, the cost of food is now on the way up.
National Foods and Fonterra say they will lift prices for milk, cheese, yoghurt and fruit juice products by up to 3 per cent, and supermarkets are expected to pass on the increase to shoppers.
The increases are to try to cope with increased packaging and transportation costs.
For farmers it is a different story, with most unable to increase their prices.
Andrew Young from the Central Markets Association says farm gate prices will not change just because wholesale prices have gone up.
"There's not an automatic link essentially unless they've got contract pricing in place, which for a lot of sectors of the industry that just doesn't exist, it's commodity market pricing," he said.

NFF seeks regional road and rail spending commitments
Farmers are calling for regional roads and rail spending to come before further investment in the Future Fund when Federal Treasurer Peter Costello hands down the Budget tomorrow night.
The fund is designed to cover future superannuation payments to public servants.
The National Farmers Federation (NFF) is warning the Government against boosting investment in the Future Fund and adding to the surplus, at the expense of infrastructure spending and tax reform.
Chief executive Ben Fargher says the Government must commit to lifting the standard of grain rail lines in New South Wales and Victoria.
And he is calling for basic all weather road access to farms and the sealing of all designated arterial roads by 2013.
"Farmers need to actually get the produce from to the farm to the National Highway in the first place," he said.
Mr Costello is already talking up big money for regional roads and rail, with spending expected to be in excess of a billion dollars.
"Better transport means a better economy with a higher speed limit for growth," he said.
The Government is also hinting at capital gains tax reform, which should help succession planning for farmers.
Meanwhile transport operators in the Northern Territory are looking for funding in the Budget to improve remote roads.
For the past fortnight 60 road trains have been unable to cross the Victoria River, west of Katherine, due to damage caused to Highway One by flooding.
The delay is estimated to have caused the industry at least $7 million, with weight restrictions only lifted at the weekend to allow single trailers through.
Scott Van-Loom of Shaw's Darwin Transport wants to see remote road funding announced tomorrow night.
"It has been the longest [delay] for a number of years. It was two weeks, which just put Darwin in chaos from Perth," he said.
"We had seven road trains there, there was a total of 60 waiting in Kununurra to get through. That was coming north, coming south there was probably about 40 road trains waiting on this side.

Oil price may pass $US100 a barrel
A transport expert says although biofuels and ethanol may help in the long term, nothing can stop oil prices hitting highs of $US100 a barrel.
David Lamb, who heads the Energy Flagship of the CSIRO, says there is no way production of any alternative fuels can match more than about 1 per cent of our energy needs.
His concern comes as a world expert on energy markets, Claude Mandil, warns that with strong demand and falling supplies, oil prices could eventually rise above $US100 a barrel.
Mr Lamb says without any alternative fuels, cutting consumption is the only option.
"By 2011 our Government's plan is to be producing 350 million litres of ethanol per year but that's only about 1 per cent of the amount of oil we use so that's no solution by 2011," he said.

Wool prices expected to pick up
A new report says wool prices are about to climb again, despite seven weeks of losses.
The eastern market indicator is 46 cents per kilogram below the seasonal high recorded in March.
The latest business survey from marketing body Woolmark says the fall was inevitable, with not enough demand to support high prices.
But with stronger orders coming through from China, western Europe and East Asia, Woolmark economist Kerry Stott says prices will pick up through the June quarter.
"It's the best it's been in almost five years," he said.
"The really good thing is that it's more widespread geographically than in the past and not only that, it seems to be more widespread right through from combing through to weaving.
"And I think if people look at what's happening to our prices in US dollars, and see that our prices are still going up in US dollars, they'd be pleasantly surprised."
The eastern market indicator closed at 708 cents a kilo clean on Friday.
Woolmark's prediction is being backed by some analysts.
Elders Queensland wool manager Maurie McNeill expects a decent recovery based on price indications out of China.
"We can probably see 20 per cent retracement of the losses that we've seen in this market over the last four or five weeks, particularly in the finer end of the market," he said.

Fears new marine park boundaries will force out fishermen
The fishing industry says new boundaries for proposed marine parks off the coasts of Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia will not restrict commercial fishing as much as first thought.
After complaints about the draft boundaries, Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell has now finalised the plans for the marine protected areas, which will cover 200,000 square kilometres of ocean.
Although the Government will provide $220 million compensation, Ross McGowan from Seafood Industry Victoria is worried about fishermen who will be forced out of the industry.
"For us to sit here and say 'it's minimised' is all well and good. But the end of the day these marine protected areas will have a significant impact on some individuals, so significant that they will have to get out of the industry," he said.

Digging finally under way at new gold mine
On the back of record prices, another gold mine has opened in Western Australia.
Tanami Gold has begun work at the Coyote project in the Tanami Desert, south-east of Halls Creek.
There have been delays to starting the desert operation because of the wet season.
With the price of gold above $880, Tanami chairman Dennis Waddell is relieved to be finally digging.
"We've had plenty of rain and that has just delayed access more than anything, but we've made that up," he said.
"We started mining on Friday, which was a pretty momentous day. The excavators and dump trucks arrived last week and we took the first bucket of ore out on Friday afternoon."

Resources boom raises housing shortage fears in silver city
The resources boom has raised fears of a housing shortage in the silver city of Broken Hill, in far western New South Wales.
With the opening of the Bemax mineral sand mine and the development of the Honeymoon uranium mine, there are concerns the town will not be able to accommodate an influx of workers.
Broken Hill real estate agent Jim Hickey says the mining industry is now looking to house workers in serviced apartments, which are in short supply.
"We're going to be shortly in need of some good development if other companies start to bring people in," he said.

Golden Circle back in the black
Queensland food processor Golden Circle has announced a jump in profits, less than three months after appointing a new chief executive.
Despite losing $26 million in 2003, the company made a $10.4 million profit before tax last year.
Chief executive John Cox says he has also improved communication between the company and its grower shareholders.
"Golden Circle recognises that we are going to have to do things a lot smarter, and more in line with our growers," he said.

Cotton results receed expectations
A gamble on this year's cotton crop appears to have paid off, although yields are down, and quality is mixed.
With harvest in full swing in New South Wales, the results are better than expected, despite a record-breaking summer heatwave.
Although growers in the Macquarie Valley faced almost zero water allocations at the start of the season, Auscott Macquarie planted almost 75 per cent of its normal acreage.
Managing director Chris Hogendyke says most has made it though.
"We got lots of allocation increases during the summer and the crops the crops turned out to be really good," he said.
"We're looking at about 10.5 bales per hectare average and we're very happy with the result.

Olive oil shortage drives up prices
South Australian olive growers are looking forward to a bumper harvest this year, with prices up and more orders than oil.
A poor European crop has compounded a worldwide shortage of olive oil, pushing prices up to between$5.50 and $6 a litre.
Olives SA chair, Lisa Rowntree, says even with the higher prices, olive producers will not be able to harvest enough oil to meet demand.
"Sales are fantastic. This is very much a seller's year for olives," she said.
"I've sold everything that I'm responsible for selling in the region and all the other growers as well have sold their olives and we could have sold them probably twice over.

Gelbvieh bull takes champion award
A Gelbvieh breed of bull has been named supreme male champion at Australia's biggest stud cattle competition at Rockhampton, in Queensland.
More than 2,000 nominations across 33 breeds for the title made it the biggest stud cattle competition in Australian history.
Guyra producer Michael Jackson, who owns the winning bull "Double J Zulu", was understandably happy about the win.
"We have been showing cattle for nearly 20 years now, and we've never won anything like this," he said.

Mine rescue comp highlights important skills
Mine safety is in the spotlight, as rescue workers continue to try to free two trapped miners in Tasmania.
Over the weekend miners in Western Australia have been testing their rescue skills at the Surface Mines Rescue Competition in Kalgoorlie.
Cindy Lewis from the Jundee gold mine, who won the best captain award, says competitors were thinking of the trapped miners and their rescuers in Beaconsfield.
"We were confronted with a situation last year at our minesite," she said.

Water costs to push commodity prices up
A national conference has heard rising water costs will push some irrigators out of primary production.
The Irrigation Association of Australia's conference in Brisbane has also heard high water costs will push up commodity prices.
Chief executive Jolyon Burnett says some irrigators face rises of up to 4,000 per cent, as water authorities move to recover more of the delivery costs.
"It is important that we attach a more realistic value to water and that there be signals, if you like, to the growers to value that water and to improve their efficiency."
Despite the rising costs, Professor Paul Perkins from the Australian National University predicts Australia will be one of the few countries in the world with enough water to grow its own food in 25 years time.
He says it is a great opportunity to expand exports.
"The global water shortage is much worse than the Australian water, so-called water crisis," he said.

Vic experts play part in mine rescue
Three mining explosives experts from Victoria have played a role in the final stages of the Beaconsfield Gold mine rescue.
The tunnel inching towards the two trapped men hit very hard silt stone, which resisted the hand drills and jack hammers.
General manager of Stawell Gold Mines Mark Mitchell says the men tested the explosives in other parts of the mine before they had to be used in the Beaconsfield rescue shaft.
"We sent the guys down to help with the PCS type explosive, which you would have heard people talking about," he said.
"We use that at Stawell Gold Mines for a number of tasks. It's something we use in the normal course of our operations. We don't consider it to be a particularly specialist thing, it's just something we have some experience in.

India tenders for 3m tonnes of wheat imports
Wheat exporter AWB will face tough competition in the latest tender from India for 3 million tonnes of wheat, which was announced overnight.
The Indian market has emerged this year as a replacement for traditional markets in the Middle East, which are buying cheaper wheat from Europe and the Black Sea.
Grains analyst Malcolm Bartholomaeus says that has left Australia and the US struggling to find other customers for last year's bumper crop.
"India is very important both for Australia and for the global wheat market this year," he said.
"Egypt, of course, is a major importer of wheat. Right at the moment they tend to be favouring cheaper wheats out of Europe and Russia, so that both Australia and the US are missing out on that particular market.
"In terms of the Australian crop, and obviously losing a lot of market share in Iraq, India is equally important from that perspective as well."
While AWB has confirmed it will tender for the contract, details on price and volume remain confidential.
Meanwhile, it is unclear if some of AWB's legal costs for the Cole inquiry will come out of the returns for the national pool.
The legal bill is likely to have blown out from the $16 million AWB shareholders were told about at the annual general meeting in February.
The chairman of AWB International, Ian Donges, says AWB Limited is picking up all accounts at the moment.
But he says there is still discussion about whether some of those should be passed onto AWB International on behalf of the pool.

Local councils 'starved of funds'
With a quarter of all local councils in New South Wales on the brink of financial collapse, farmers are calling for changes to Australia's system of government.
A symposium held in Sydney has heard experts on governance discuss how local councils are struggling to cope with new responsibilities and a lack of funds.
Former president of the NSW Farmers Association, Mal Peters, says state governments are ignoring rural communities and what is needed is a system of government that is closer to the people.

Credit scheme changes anger farmers
Impending changes to the energy grants credits scheme have not been welcomed in rural Australia.
Until now, claiming the 18 cents a litre credit has been a simple process of posting off a claim form and getting the money back quickly.
But from July 1, the fuel rebate will be delivered through the GST reporting process.
For farmers and other agricultural businesses who are not filing a monthly Business Activity Statement, it will take much longer to get the money back.
Livestock transporter Jim Savage, from Tamworth in New South Wales, fears delayed payments will create problems with cash flow.
"See you, you gotta be up front to pay your fuel bill, otherwise there'd be no fuel," he said.

Bananas doing big business for NSW farmers
Banana growers on the north coast of New South Wales are continuing to harvest some spectacular profits in the wake of cyclone Larry.
Mullumbimby wholesaler Jan Trueman says cartons of fruit that fetched about $10 to $12 before the devastation of the Queensland industry, are now worth between $60 and $80.
He says it is set to become even more lucrative as winter approaches.
"Oh most definitely, for sure," he said.
"Our fruit is, y'know, is at a premium now and going into winter, I mean our fruit starts to slow up anyway, so it's only going to get dearer and dearer.

World trade changes pose problems for fruit growers
Tasmanian apple growers are feeling the pressure of change in Australian horticulture and are hosting a meeting later this month to address their future.
Thomas Frankcomb from Fruit Growers Tasmania says the industry is at "yet another cross roads", with significant changes in global production, market prices and the threat of cheaper imported fruit.
He hopes the meeting will help growers make choices about their future and believes the issues are bigger than just one state or one sector.

PETA takes aim at Middle East
Animal rights group PETA says it will target Middle Eastern countries for the first time, as part of its campaign to stop live exports from Australia.
The group says it will reveal alleged abuses in slaughterhouses in several Gulf countries at a press conference next week in Dubai.

Incitec Pivot to buy Southern Cross
In a complex stock market deal, superphosphate fertiliser company Incitec Pivot has announced it plans to buy out Australia's only producer of ammonium phosphates, Southern Cross.
Trading in Incitec Pivot shares has been halted for two days while share holders learn details of the deal, which includes Orica selling its 70 per cent share holding in Incitec.
Incitec will recommend share holders buy back Orica shares.
Chairman of Incitec Pivot John Watson says the 35,000 farmers with shares in the company should enjoy significant growth in profits.
"All this does is add to our manufacturing base a very important strategic asset, not only for our business but for the farmers of Australia as well," he said.

Scientists successfully grow southern bluefin tuna cell cultures
In a world first, South Australian scientists have grown cell cultures of the southern bluefin tuna.
Flinders University and the CSIRO have grown the cells so they can experiment with antioxidants to extend the shelf life of tuna and test for viruses.
Dr Kathy Schuller from Flinders University says it is much cheaper than using live tuna worth $50 a kilogram.
"We can test 24 different concentrations and combinations of antioxidants at a time," she said.

Unwanted grapes to be used in non-alcoholic sparkling wine
A small group of grape growers in South Australia hope to use up their unwanted fruit by cracking into the non-alcoholic sparkling wine market.
The Virginia Horticulture Centre, north of Adelaide, has begun a pilot project to see if it is viable.

Dingoes may be used to sniff out cane toads
Enlisting dingoes is the latest suggestion to help keep Western Australia free of cane toads.
Dog trainer Sarah Fyffe has applied for a licence to use dingoes as sniffer dogs at the border and in bushland between Western Australia and the Northern Territory.
She says dingoes are naturals for the outdoor job,
"We're not talking about working in a building, we're not talking about working in an airport, we're talking about working in rugged terrain," she said.
"[It is] very unforgiving - and where's the dingo from? That's its natural habitat and they cope brilliantly with it and know how to handle the elements."

Budget good news for rural Australians
There is a fair bit of good news for rural Australia out of Treasurer Peter Costello's 11th Budget.
There is more than $2 billion in extra funding for roads and rail, money for the Murray River and a big crackdown on illegal fishing.
There are also wide ranging tax cuts, which are supposed to leave more money in our pockets and changes to capital gains tax to make it easier for farmers to pass on their properties.
President of the National Farmers Federation Peter Corish is certainly happy.
"This Budget is probably the most positive budget that Treasurer Costello has delivered for rural Australia," he said.
"NFF had three major priorities leading into this Budget, the first one was sustainability, the second one was infrastructure and the third one was taxation relief for rural Australia.
"And I can say that positively we've had movement on all three areas."
More rural Australians will also be able to access the aged pension.
There will also be incentives for farm and mining businesses to invest in new plant and equipment with changes to depreciation rates.
There will also be around $50 million for extra mental health services in country areas.

Vaile starts Budget sell
The Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Nationals, Mark Vaile, has been out this morning telling rural areas the Budget sets up the bush to take advantage of the current resources boom through big infrastructure spending.
He is especially proud, as most National party members are, of the $2.4 billion in roads funding he says the Nationals have helped secure.
"If you are talking about regional Australia, my view is one of the most important targeted components in this budget is that $307 million of extra money directed at local governments for local roads and bridges this year, they're the important things to regional Australia," he said.
When Australia's peak rural lobby group the National Farmers Federation says this is the best Budget in 11 years, that should not leave too much room for the Opposition to be critical.
But that has not stopped Labor's agriculture spokesman Gavan O'Connor describing the Budget as missed opportunities.
His point is you can have all the new bitumen in world but if it is not too dear to drive on that bitumen because of high fuel prices and higher interest rates, well the big spending backfires.
He is also talking up what he says is the Government's failure to target its infrastructure spending, failure to address environmental issues and failure to ease skills shortages in regional areas.
"No mention of the productivity challenge and no attempt to get on top of the foreign debt," he said.
"No attempt to address the massive skills crisis in rural Australia and there's no movement on the last great frontier for Australian agriculture that is the regeneration of our soils.
"There is no attempt to engineer through these expenditures a new wave of research and innovation in the rural sector.
"On that basis I think there will be some significant questions asked about this Budget."

Punters
What do the punters think of the Budget?
"For me, I'm in a retirement age so the amount that I can earn tax-free has gone up, the threshold there, so I think the threshold for low-income earners has been very good," one person said.
"It's quite encouraging about the water, that's going to be the biggest problem and I think people in the towns have got to realise that they've got to pay more for their water and not be so greedy and they've got to do something about storage," another said.
"I think the Budget lacks vision because it should have looked at the longer term infrastructure issues and I just think that politicians are driven by short term decision making all the time which we pay a big price for," a third person said.

Economist warns about spending
The tax cuts are expected to ease pressure on rural households which have faced higher petrol prices and grocery bills in recent months.
The experts say while the cuts will not put pressure on interest rates in the short term, there are no guarantees the Reserve Bank will not increase rates towards the end of the year.
ANZ chief economist Saul Eslake says there are still reasons to be cautious about spending.
"Even allowing for the fact that people in rural areas tend to drive longer distances than those in the city, the tax cuts are enough to offset the most recent roughly 10 cent a litre increase in petrol prices and the rise in interest rates," he said.
"But any further rise in petrol prices or indeed in interest rates would probably be sufficient to eliminate the benefits of the Budget tax cut altogether."
Meanwhile Treasurer Peter Costello told a media conference yesterday the only way fuel prices will come down is if the cost of crude oil falls.
There is more than $11 million allocated for two new studies on the use of biofuels but Greens Senator Christine Milne says Mr Costello is wasting his time spending up big on roads, when it is becoming too expensive to drive on them.
"He's about the only person in Australia who doesn't see increasing oil prices as a major issue," she said.

Industry group concerned about lack of initiatives
There is concern about a lack of initiatives in the Budget to improve the national skills base and tackle the labor shortage in Australia.
Although new measures have been announced to make it easier for overseas workers, the Australian Industry Group says the Budget should have made more progress in big nation building projects.
While happy with many of the initiatives announced for business and the road funding, Heather Ridout says there is a long way to go to provide the necessary infrastructure to improve productivity and cope with future demand.
"I think that's another area where there could have been more done," she said.
"They're certainly bringing forward some of the spending which is important, some increase in road funding but it needs a more coherent plan.
"We still need better interaction between road and rail, I think we still need more of a national plan and that's got to be really agreed between the states being very big spenders in this area.

Little in budget to encourage exploration, says mining group
The WA Chamber of Minerals and Energy says there is little in the Budget to encourage exploration in the resources sector.
The industry wants a flow-through shares scheme to boost exploration but did not have any joy last night.
Chamber director David Parker says more needs to be done there as well.
"This is something which industry has been arguing for a number of years," he said.
"We see exploration as very much the future of the resources industry.
"We are tending to rest on our laurels in terms of the future sustainability of the industry.
"I think if you look at the medium to long term outlook for renewing Australia's resources inventory we really are at cross roads.

Budget fails to tackle climate change, green groups say
The Federal Government has come under fire from green groups, which claim the Budget fails to tackle climate change.
The major allocation in environmental spending is $500 million for the Murray Darling Basin Commission.
That money will fund projects like salt interception schemes, fishways, local and weir upgrades, and possibly buying water from farmers.
South Australian River Murray Minister Karlene Maywald says the money has been desperately needed.
"Projects were underfunded, the Murray Darling Basin Commission was underfunded, our projects that we all agreed to from a jurisdictional point of view were all starting to slip and it looked like we were never going to achieve what we needed to do to save the River Murray," she said.

Budget boosts funding for illegal fishing fight
The Federal Government has announced a big crack down on illegal fishing in Australia's northern waters.
The $389 million package is designed to double the number of boats apprehended each year through increased surveillance and patrols, along with improved boat-burning facilities to destroy illegal fishing boats.
Indigenous coastal rangers will also be employed as part of the plan but Gary Ward from the Gulf of Carpentaria Commercial Fishermen's Association says the money is being used in the wrong way.
"Spending this money on Aboriginal communities is very fine but you're talking about a radius of probably 25 kilometres each side of the community," he said.
"Now these boats range widely over the Gulf of Carpentaria, we need more surveillance but we need more active now, the fishing fraternity in the Gulf of Carpentaria that's worked so hard for a sustainable and viable fishery has been left out in the lurch."

Plan unveiled to secure veg industry future
A new $3 million strategy to secure the future of the vegetable industry has been unveiled in Brisbane this morning.
VegVision 2020 is the product of months of talks between growers, the Federal Government, supermarkets and food processors.
It is a $3 million plan with a very simple message - how to lift the industry's growth from an unsustainable 3 per cent by getting more vegetables on consumers' plates.
Fair Dinkum Food Campaigner Richard Bovill is a member of the Australian Vegetable Industry Development Group and says growers must work with retailers and processors if they are to secure their future.
"There are adversarial issues out there, there will always be competitive pressures but we also have to understand our common goals and work together with those," he said.
"I think we can look to a range of different industry models and we shouldn't just look at vegetables and the horticultural sector."

US Farm Bill debate begins
The battle has started early in Washington over the next US Farm Bill, due to be drafted next year.
The White House and Congress do not see eye to eye on farm policy.
While US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns and the White House are calling for sweeping changes in US farm policy, lawmakers are defending the status quo.
Top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee Collin Peterson told a farm bill field hearing in Texas, US agriculture should not be singled out for cuts.
"This budget talk irritates me a little bit because agriculture did not cause these budget problems. And I do not agree that we ought to be the ones that have to pay the price because we've actually saved money," he said.

Row erupts between Grains Council and Agriculture Minister
A rift has emerged between Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran and Australia's peak grain lobby.
The Grains Council is outraged that the oil-for-food inquiry is being used as an excuse to backflip on plans to reduce a key levy for the Wheat Export Authority.
The council wanted the industry levy reduced from 22 cents a tonne to 19, leaving the authority with a million dollar cash surplus.
Spokesman David Ginns says the surplus will now be doubled and has accused Mr McGauran of ignoring growers.
"There have been a number of matters that we've raised with him where he hasn't taken the advice of the key industry body and we are concerned that our batting average is not particularly good at the moment and we seem to be getting some excuses back at the moment," he said.
But in an unprecedented attack on a peak commodity council, Mr McGauran has accused the Grains Council of acting dishonourably and not working in the best interests of growers.
Mr McGauran says the council has also deliberately leaked confidential ministerial documents and spread misinformation.
"I believe this is an ill-considered and ill-timed intervention by the Grains Council which is more puzzling than anything else," he said.

Saltbush shrubland plan angers graziers
Graziers in western New South Wales are furious about a proposal to list old man saltbush shrubland as endangered.
The New South Wales Scientific Committee has found saltbush shrubland has fallen by 70 per cent since European settlement and the rest is at risk of extinction from clearing and grazing.
But Graham Morphett, who has a property north-west of Hay, says the plant is thriving in the western division due to good management and rabbit control.
"I've got 170,000 acres out here and I have tens of thousands of acres of old man saltbush with up to 5,000 acre stands," he said.

Calls to scrap WET tax
The Western Australian wine industry wants the Wine Equalisation Tax (WET) abolished despite a big Budget boost.
The Federal Government has increased tax rebates to smaller wine producers by $210,000.
They are available to producers with up to $1.7 million in sales.
But Ron Fraser from the Margaret River Wine Association says it is band-aid therapy, which is lulling smaller producers into a false sense of security
"It's avoiding the issue that the WET tax is an impost on the cost of wine and should be scrapped altogether," he said.
"The only way that you can get the benefits from this extra threshold is to increase your sales and in today's market to increase your sales is an increasingly difficult job.

Grape growers mull mothballing vines
Grape growers in South Australia's Riverland are considering mothballing their vines, hoping to ride out the industry's oversupply.
Many local growers could not sell their fruit this year, with wineries suspending or not renewing contracts.
With no relief in sight, growers say they could prune heavily or use chemicals to hinder fruit growth to hibernate vines instead of having to pull them out.
Berri grape grower Bill Ruediger says he will have to make a decision very soon.

ACCC to investigate Sunbeam price-setting
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) will investigate whether dried fruit processor Sunbeam Foods breached the Trade Practices Act in setting low prices this season.
ACCC Commissioner John Martin held talks with growers in Mildura in north-west Victoria this week after the Victorian Farmers Federation lodged complaints of unconscionable conduct by the industry's major processor.
Growers claim Sunbeam is taking advantage of its virtual monopoly position in the industry, and has set prices at a 20-year low.

Rural property values tipped to even out
Rural property values have doubled and in some cases tripled in just four years, outperforming most other capital investments.
But they could be about to come off the boil.
Wayne Carlson from the National Australia Bank says prices are expected to even out in the next 12 to 24 months.
"We probably don't really expect prices to come down," he said.
"We expect more a plateau effect.
"These may be some discount in the lower, standard and marginal type lends. And there's no doubt the trend of this off-farm investment super funds, managed investment schemes et cetera will continue to tip money into this market.

Plantation tax reform plans unveiled
The Federal Government has unveiled proposed changes to tax incentives for investors in the plantation timber sector.
The incentives, which currently provide 100 per cent tax deductions for managed investment schemes, have been under review for the past 12 months.
Dr Judy Clark, from the Australian National University (ANU), says the draft changes which will affect investor interest.
"Putting a cap on the immediate volume of money that can be tax deducted and you also add on that reduction in top marginal tax rat from 47 to 45 per cent, both of these work to down play the attractiveness of these schemes for investors," she said.
"We don't need to plant more softwood to meet Australia's entire timber needs.

Marine park boundaries 'botched'
The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) wants changes to the way boundaries are established for national marine parks.
It says the new park between Tasmania and the mainland is a botched job, which fails to protect marine biodiversity.
The park's boundaries were redrawn after concerns from the fishing sector.
The MCS's Craig Bohm says the revised boundaries have missed biodiverisity hotspots, and the Federal Government must review the process.

G-G heads up Birdsville Track
Governor-General Michael Jeffrey has embarked on a journey up the Birdsville Track to attract attention to life in the outback.
Accompanied by his valet, doctor, physio and other escorts, the Governor-General will spend five days meeting people from remote communities as part of the Year of the Outback.
Major-General Jeffrey hopes the trip will inspire others.
"I hope to expose the characters the lifestyle, some of the difficulties of course," he said.

Leaping croc shocks scientists
An airborne four-metre crocodile has made scientists' hearts skip a beat during research on the Ord River in the far north of Western Australia.
Scientists had been using an electrical current to temporarily stun fish, so as to study them.
But they accidentally sent a shock wave through a nearby crocodile.
Scott Goodson from the Department of Environment says the jumping croc gave everyone a start.
"He breached the water, he got a metre out of the water, that's a big croc!" he said.
"He got a fairly good tickle up, I would have thought!"
Mr Goodson says the reptile is probably just a bit stunned after the accidental shock treatment.
"He's probably taken off and just kicking back behind another rock, I don't think he will come too close to that boat again," he said.

AWB hopes to salvage India wheat deal
Wheat exporter AWB hopes last minute talks can salvage a half million tonne wheat deal with India.
Indian authorities have raised new concerns about quality issues, this time with wheat which has not even left Australia.
The first consignment of wheat under the deal was held up last week while tests for pesticide contamination were carried out. Those tests cleared the wheat for unloading.
National pool manager with AWB David Johnson says the company is trying to limit the damage to growers, with the national pool bearing any cost of delays.
"We are looking to mitigate an exposure, cost to growers, by potentially diverting some of those vessels to other markets," he said.

Cole inquiry hears from ex-UN customs official
The Cole inquiry has reconvened in Sydney to hear the evidence of former UN customs official Felicity Johnston.
Ms Johnston has told the inquiry she informed Australian Government officials in both Washington and New York about inland transport fees being paid by AWB to the Iraqi Government.
Ms Johnston appeared at the inquiry via video link from Washington.
She told senior counsel assisting John Agius she mentioned the inland transportation payments in discussion with DFAT's delegate at the Australian mission to the UN, Bronte Moules and with AusTrade Commissioner Alistair Nicholas.
Ms Johnston said she raised the issue in January and March 2000 following a complaint from the Canadians.

Govt accused of using Budget to shore up Nationals' vote
The Federal Government has attacked Labor's plans for a national high-speed broadband network, accusing it of allocating rural telecommunications money to the cities.
But Labor leader Kim Beazley has used his Budget reply speech to criticise the Government for basing roads spending on shoring up National party votes.
Mr Beazley says Labor would provide free Tafe for traditional trades, more childcare places across Australia and put a stop to importing foreign apprentices.
He also criticised the Government for failing to invest in climate change research, do more to tackle water shortages and laid down plans to provide all businesses and households with fast Internet.
"To you and me this means a broadband system 25 times faster than the sorts of speeds available in Australia today," he said.
But the Government says Labor plans to spend $2 billion earmarked for rural telecommunications to fund broadband in the city.
And National Farmers Federation president Peter Corish says money Labor wants for its plans is already being spent.

Heemskirk wind farm mothballed
The Federal Government's decision not to increase renewable energy targets is being blamed for a decision to mothball Tasmania's $300 million Heemskirk wind farm.
Tasmanian energy company Roaring 40s says it remains committed to existing Australian projects but will be wind back work on new developments.
Managing director Mark Kelleher says there are no incentives for electricity retailers to buy wind energy, making Heemskirk unviable.

Controls on explosive chemicals sales to be tightened
The Queensland Government is further tightening controls on the sale of explosive chemicals after the arrest of a Brisbane man found to be in the possession of 53 kilograms of explosives.
The Government will meet with farm and mining groups in Brisbane today to discuss the implications of the new controls.
Police allege a Brisbane high school teacher illegally purchased the explosive Powergel from chemical company Orica under the pretense of using it for movie stunts.
The 40-year-old is expected to be the first Queenslander charged with terrorism.
The Queensland Government has announced sellers of chemicals, like ammonium nitrate used by farmers, will need to report fortnightly to the Government on who they sell explosive materials to and even call the Department of Natural Resources to double-check the details of new and existing customers.

NQ wildlife to benefit from grape glut
Grape growers are having trouble getting rid of their fruit this year, but one solution has been to send it to north Queensland, to feed hungry wildlife.
With habitat destroyed by cyclone Larry, surplus grapes from Lopresti Wines in South Australia are being fed to birds like the Southern Cassowary.
Scott Sullivan from Queensland's Parks and Wildlife Service, says they are happy to get them.

Cape calls for cyclone assistance
Graziers, tourism operators and Indigenous communities on Cape York are calling for immediate financial help from the Federal Government in the wake of Cyclone Monica.
The cyclone brought heavy rain and severe flooding to the cape, and graziers say there been widespread damage to roads, and huge stock losses.
The Cape communities want to know why they cannot access the same assistance offered to victims of cyclone Larry.
Cape grazier Darcy Burns says they are desperate.
"It looks like Larry's got everything," he said.
"We're not hearing one word on Monica, I think people have forgotten how much damage that's done up there.
"We understand fully about Innisfail's done and they need all the support they can get, we're not knocking that at all, but they've also got to look at us as well, there's people up there at the moment, we've lost our income for the next 12 months because we can't get in there, and the season's so short now."

WA farmers unhappy with state Budget
The Western Australian Government has handed down its budget, but it has failed to excite the agricultural sector.
The Government has confirmed a surplus of $2 billion for this financial year, with the windfall to pay for the Perth to Mandurah railway.
Trevor de Landgraft from the WA Farmers Federation says rural people have been ignored.

Rural jobs hard to fill: survey
A joint federal and Victorian government survey suggests one third of rural employers cannot fill job vacancies.
The survey of the Wimmera Grampians region is being rolled out across the state, with the results to be compared with other states and territories.
Penny Ireland, from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, says professional and trade positions in health, finance and construction are the hardest to fill.
"There were a lot of health related professional occupations so general practitioner, registered nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists. There was also a number of trades positions, in particular motor mechanics, which we see across the country and electricians," she said.
Meanwhile, grey nomads are being used to temporarily fill some of the shortages in central Australia.
Under the Outback Links program, retired travellers are helping to fix the plumbing, or mind children on outback stations , in exchange for a taste of remote living.
Gold Coast retiree Bobbie Perkins is the first volunteer to be placed, and says helping with the housework on New Crown Station, south of Alice Springs, is actually a good way to learn about rural Australia.

Biosecurity plan to protect northern WA
Australia's first regional biosecurity plan is being launched today in Kununurra, in the far north of Western Australia.
Ord Guard will educate groups from local Indigenous communities to travellers, on plant disease threats and prevention in the Ord River region.
With up to 120,000 visitors passing through each year, Dr Simon Mckirdie from the CRC for Plant Biosecurity, says educating tourists is a key part of the plan,

Seafood lovers to feel the pinch on crab prices
Commercial crab fishermen in the Northern Territory say they are potting just over half the number of crabs they used to, because of new catch size rules.
The minimum catch size of both female and male mud crabs has increased by a centimetre, but anglers say there are not many around at this time of year.
Melbourne seafood wholesaler, Spencer Wilkinson says diners could be wrestling bigger crabs on the dinner plate in the future, if they can afford them.
"It will just price itself out of the market and what happens is, when it gets to exorbitant levels, the Sydney market soaks up basically all the crab," he said.

Govt tight-lipped on Snowy Hydro sale
The New South Wales Government has confirmed an international offer for Snowy Hydro, but says it needs to keep tight-lipped on the details.
State Finance Minister John Della Bosca said yesterday any discussion of detail before the release of the prospectus would incur the risk of litigation.
But Lester Wheatly, chair of the Murray Valley Community Action group, says it is just an excuse to keep the public in the dark.
"The Government attitude is that "look here, we're involved in very sensitive international negotiations at the moment and can't tell you anything". At the end of the day, that's just not good enough.

Two in running for peak farm job
Australia's top job in agripolitics will be contested for the first time in four years, with Peter Corish set to step down as president of the National Farmers Federation.
NFF trade representative Allan Burgess and former Meat and Livestock Australia chairman David Crombie have nominated for the key post.
Mr Corish will not comment on speculation he will contest the seat of Gwydir in the next election, which will be vacated by former deputy prime minister John Anderson.
He says water reform and more money for rural telecommunications have been major achievements during his presidency.
"The National Water Initiative I think is a key opportunity that we've locked in while I've been NFF president," he said.
"We've made significant progress in the area of workplace reform, we have locked in significant funding for rural Australia in regard to telecommunications, and I've enjoyed my time immensely over the four years."
Board elections will be held at the next NFF annual general meeting on June 14 and 15.
Meanwhile former executive director of the NFF, Rick Farley has died.
Mr Farley was making a slow recovery after a stroke, but died from injuries he received after falling from a wheelchair outside Sydney's Balmain Hospital at the weekend.
In the mid-70s Rick Farley became the first executive director of the newly formed Cattlemen's Union (CU) in Queensland.
With a background in the arts, time spent in the hippy capital of Nimbin and a job with Labor health spokesperson Doug Everingham, Mr Farley was not an obvous choice to head up the organisation, most of whose members were staunch National Party supporters.
But from his days in Rockhampton with the CU, the farmers' rally in 1985 in Canberra, the foundation of the Landcare moverment in the late 80s and then the native title debate in the 90s Rick Farley was a smart political operator, In Canberra he cut a distinctive character in moleskins, boots and Akubra and as Cattlemen's first preisident Sir Grahman McCamley says he was an extremely effective lobbyist on behalf of the farm sector.

Vaile leaves door ajar for Katter
Leader of the National Party Mark Vaile says he would push for another ministry position if Queensland Independent Bob Katter rejoined the party.
There is speculation Mr Katter will seek membership of the Nationals, after contesting the last election in his seat of Kennedy as an Independent.
The Nationals lost a ministry position earlier this year when Senator Julian McGauran crossed to the Liberal Party.
Mr Vaile has told the Nine Network he is keeping an open mind about Mr Katter.
"Politics is about numbers and if someone wants to commit to the ideals and the philosophies of our particular party or our government then they're most welcome, so I'd keep an open mind on that particular matter," he said.

Opponents speak out against Qld dam proposal
More than 3,000 people attended a weekend protest rally in the Queensland city of Gympie, to fight the proposed Mary River Dam.
The State Government is planning a 660,000 megalitre dam at Traveston Crossing, south of the city, to supply the water needs of Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast.
The Government made its first property acquisition late last week, only days after announcing a $50 million package to begin the buyback process.
Local mayors, a federal member of parliament, conservationists and landholders addressed the public meeting.
Farmer Ian Allen says a fighting fund has also been established.
"My farm is affected as much anyone else's," he said.
"I've spent a long time getting where I want to get, I just felt like I'm there, and this announcement of a dam has put me back where I started 20-30 years ago.

Lamb production springs to new high
Australian lamb production hit a new record during the first three months of 2006, despite challenging seasonal conditions.
Meat and Livestock Australia says the average jump of 8 per cent came as a surprise, with the biggest gains in Victoria and WA, where there is a continuing shift away from growing wool.
Despite the growing stock numbers, exports are up and prices remain just 10 per cent under the all-time highs.
Grazier Peter Small from Victoria's western district, says it breaks his heart to turn away from wool, but there is a lot more money to be made out of lamb.
"Well it is what we have done but we are reluctant to do it," he said.

Farmers log on to livestock sales
Rising fuel costs and more user-friendly technology are said to be driving a jump in the number of farmers selling livestock over the Internet.
Elders sells around 3 per cent of Australia's sheep, lambs and cattle in online auctions.
Jack Gleeson from Elders says it is saving farmers the cost of trucking livestock to saleyards.
"Normally there would be freight involved from the point of origin, the vendor's property to the saleyard," he said.

Big drop in US wheat production tipped
The US Agriculture Department is tipping an 11 per cent drop in wheat production there over the next 12 months.
The latest forecast is for a total harvest in 2006-07 of $1.8 billion bushels.
USDA World Agriculture Outlook Board Chairman Gerald Bange blames chronic drought and tough competition from Australia and Canada for lower exports.
"We're looking at exports, beginning June 1 at about 900 million bushels, which would be about 100 million bushels lower than we will export in the 2005/06 year, which is currently estimated at an even 1 billion bushels," he said.
Mr Bange says part of the reason is a stronger US price forecast in '06/'07 due to lower production and tighter ending stocks.
Wheat prices look set to improve on the back of the USDA report, which has also revealed a substantial increase in corn exports.
There is also higher domestic demand in the US for corn to make ethanol.
Natham Omodei from commodity trader Plum Grove, says that should make wheat more attractive as feed for livestock and drive up prices.
"They increased use for ethanol production, which really cut their stock forecasts for 2006-2007," he said.

NSW Govt announces department restructure
The New South Wales Government has announced a major restructure of the Department of Natural Resources in a bid to save $16 million a year.
Fifty employees are being moved from Sydney to Orange, and voluntary redundancies are being offered for non-frontline staff.
Farmers are also worried about a decision to scrap regional director positions.
But Jeff Angel from the Total Environment Centre says the changes will speed up reform.
"You're not going to get the unbelievable and untrustworthy level of inconsistent decision-making that we had under the previous system," he said.
"You can go way too far in having autonomous regions.

Fly slows weed threat in Timor
A natural predator is slowing the spread of the world's worst weed across our northern neighbours.
The stem galling fly has been introduced across East and West Timor, to control siam weed.
Researcher Rob Williams says the Australian-funded project also reduces the chance of the weed gaining a foothold in the Northern Territory.
"Siam weed can be seen in 90 per cent of the countryside in East Timor, and it covers the grasslands," he said.
The (stem) gall flies are re-producing here. They released 200 gall flies here last year. The gall flies survived through the dry season and are growing here now.

Tassie farmer recognised by vege industry
A Tasmanian potato farmer has been named the Young Vegetable Grower of the Year, for his leadership during the Fair Dinkum Food campaign.
Matthew Ryan from northern Tasmania was honoured at the national conference of AusVeg in Brisbane at the weekend.
He says the campaign raised the profile of the vegetable industry, but there is still more to be done.

Royal Flying Doctor Service turns 78
The Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) is celebrating its 78th birthday today.
Reverend John Flynn established the Flying Doctors at Cloncurry in north-west Queensland back in 1928.
Senior flight nurse at the Mount Isa base, Mary Noon, says the RFDS has come a long way since then, but still plays an essential role in remote areas.
"One day you can be delivering a baby, and the next day you're helping somebody with chest pain, so it's a huge variation," she said.
"You get to meet such a variety of people, you get to see new places, different places every day as opposed to the ward.

Mining losses a correction, say analysts
The mining sector has had a rough couple of days, with metal prices falling sharply on the commodity markets overnight.
Copper was the biggest loser, at one stage falling 9 per cent, with gold down 4 per cent, and silver 5 per cent.
But analysts say it is not a global market meltdown, merely a long overdue correction on the minerals boom.
Malcolm Condie, from AWB Landmark, says the mining sector has taken the biggest battering, and agricultural commodities should escape relatively unscathed.
He says the fundamentals for wool prices are unchanged, the poor US crop has strengthened wheat prices and demand from Asia and India for other agricultural commodities will continue to strengthen.
"I don't see any further risk or downside risk for wool at this stage," he said.
"We might see the market just tread water for a little while now.
"Obviously grain, wheat is on a bit of an upward spiral and I mean generally there is no correlation between those and the other mineral commodities that we export. But obviously as far as food stuffs go people have to eat and I think we are going to see a lot more going into Asia."
Rising inflation fears in the US have largely contributed to the weaker commodity prices.
The All Ordinaries Index had fallen 93 points at the close of trade yesterday, with bulk-commodity companies like BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto the hardest hit.
Chris Monroe of Hartleys says it was the correction the market, "had to have."
"Another cliche, the market was, "priced to perfection" I think," he said.

NFF contender seeks to build trust between cities and bush
The man widely tipped to be the next head of the National Farmers Federation (NFF) says his main priority will be rebuilding trust between urban and country areas.
The former chairman of Meat and Livestock Australia David Crombie, has been asked to run for the NFF presidency by two state farming groups.
He says farmers need the support of city people to defeat extreme animal rights groups, which he says is a key issue for Australian agriculture.
Mr Crombie, who lives in Brisbane, says he is not a typical farmer, but does not think that stops him being an effective leader of Australia's most powerful rural lobby group.
"No, I'm certainly not an average farmer because I currently live in Brisbane, but certainly my interests are in agriculture and all of my professional life I've been involved in agriculture. I believe I have something to offer. I believe I can make a difference," he said.

NSW farmers chief quits
The chief executive of the New South Wales Farmers Association has resigned, effective immediately.
Dr Ray Johnson has completed only two years of his three year contract, but the association will not say whether he will be paid out.
President Jock Laurie rejects suggestions the former chief executive was pushed by a divided board.

Cool reaction to Qld water plan
The Queensland Government is looking to buy two large cotton properties in the state's south-west to return water to the Murray-Darling Basin.
The buy-up is expected to cost up to $60 million and deliver 58,000 megalitres of water a year over the New South Wales border.
The Federal Government rejected a similar proposal four years ago to purchase the huge Cubbie Station.
Grazier Pot Peterson is among New South Wales landholders who have been critical of the amount of water Queensland irrigators take out of the Condamine-Balonne river system, and says this plan will not be very beneficial.
"I'm not saying that they shouldn't purchase it, but I just think it would be far more beneficial if they purchased something upstream that would have a big affect on us, because really the water virtually stops at Cubbie," he said.
"As we saw in the 2004 flood they did have a big flood at St George but we didn't get any of it here."
The plan will be out to the Murray-Darling Ministerial Council meeting in Melbourne on Friday.
Meanwhile the Cubbie Group, which runs Cubbie Station, has slammed calls by the New South Wales Government for its water allocation to be reduced.
The station can store 500,000 megalitres of water for its cotton-growing operation, and graziers south of the border complain they are being starved of crucial flood water flows.
But joint managing director John Grabbe says New South Wales should fix up evaporation losses in the Menindee Lakes in the state's west, before attacking Queensland's science-based water allocations.
"Oh get your own house in order, but let's be fair dinkum, not just throw stones at each other, but let's be fair dinkum," he said.
"I mean, water is too valuable a resource to be going up into the air in shallow storage systems. Now we don't do it at Cubbie, and I implore the southern states to seriously look at their storage systems.
Federal Agricultural Minister Peter McGauran says the CSIRO is scare-mongering, with a report calling for bigger environmental flows for the Murray River.
An extra 500 gigalitres has already been committed to the Murray, but the scientific body says up to five times more will be needed to restore the river's health.
Despite criticising that finding, Mr McGauran acknowledges progress has been slow on the Living Murray Initiative, and says the report will be considered.

Eldest children not always the best farm managers: research
New research has shown the tradition of passing the farm onto the eldest child could be costing the sector its best talent.
Psychologist and social researcher, Dr Ian Ploughman, says by nature, older children are more conservative.
He says younger siblings tend to be the most innovative and creative, but do not have the opportunity to contribute.
"The younger brothers and sisters commonly have less interest in staying on the farm, and are more creative and more mobile," he said.

Debt an obstacle to wool merger
The wool industry remains committed to a merger between its promotion and research arms, despite a dispute over a $27 million debt.
Australian Wool Services, which owns the Woolmark brand, is seeking financial help from the Federal Government to pay the debt, without success.
The owed money relates to a pension fund for former UK-based employees.
Chairman of Australian Wool Innovation Ian McLachlan says he understands the Government's position, but there will not be a merger between the two companies until the bill is paid.
"I've been in government and I think when a government has a position, it has to repeat that position, and it will hold that position until somebody comes up with a really bright idea as to how we can solve it," he said.

AWB searches for new market for stranded wheat
Wheat exporter AWB says it is trying to find another market for a shipment of wheat stranded at Geraldton in Western Australia, due to a quarantine dispute with India.
The ship has been docked for a month, while talks have been under way to resolve the problem.
The ship is expected to be loaded today.
Paul Ryan, AWB's industry relations manager in WA, says two other vessels have been unloaded successfully in India, but he cannot say why this vessel has been in port for so long.
"It is more to do with a range of quarantine restrictions, in terms of bringing wheat into India," he said.

WA exercise to test response to foot and mouth outbreak
An operation dubbed "Exercise Wild West" starts today in Western Australia to test the ability of authorities to fight a foot and mouth disease outbreak.
The simulated exercise will run until Friday, and involves 180 people from the Department of Agriculture and Food and other agencies.
Director of Animal Biosecurity Ashley Mercy says an outbreak in Australia similar to the 2001 United Kingdom outbreak would cost the Australian economy about $15 billion.

Northern growers put price cap on bananas
It is pretty rare for producers to knock back money, but with soaring prices a small group of north Queensland banana growers have decided to put a price cap on their fruit.
Pacific Coast Eco Bananas, which won an award last night for farming in an environmentally sustainable manner, says sustainability needs to apply to all sectors of the business.
In the wake of cyclone Larry some bananas have sold for more than $100 a carton, but the company's Dianne Sciacca says that level cannot be sustained, with the price cap set at $70.
"I think if you're serious about sustainability, you have to live within a sustainable business environment as well and we ask a premium price for our product of which that is supported by the supermarkets and our customers in the market place," she said.

Scientists consider climate change challenges
Scientists are meeting in Sydney today to tackle climate change.
The scientists from CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology and the Greenhouse Office are debating strategies they say need to be implemented to adapt to the changing climate.
Principal scientist with the CSIRO, Kevin Hennessy says it is likely farmers will be forced to make big changes.
"We would need to look at improving water use efficiency, water recycling, so reduce the amount of evaporation from some of our irrigation channels, and smarter ways of farming, for example direct drilling of seeds, retaining the stubble to reduce both erosion and water usage, and I guess some challenges for the types of crops that we use," he said.

Land use bid concerns fishing industry
Members of the aquaculture and fishing industries on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula say they are worried about the possible impact of Aboriginal claims over the region's coastal waters.
Negotiations have begun for Indigenous Land Use Agreements (ILUA), covering coastal land and waters from Cowell to Venus Bay.
Michael Whillas from the Seafood Council of South Australia says because the process is new, there are uncertainties about the future legal status of aquaculture leases and fishing rights.
"The problem that we face is that under the Native Title Act, a native title claim is extinguished when there is an existing licence or lease," he said.
"Under the ILUA, that doesn't necessarily happen. At this stage, there are some grey areas.

Group opposes giving national parks back to traditional owners
A campaign to prevent 17 national parks being returned to their traditional owners has stepped up in the Northern Territory.
The Territory Government intends to hand over the land title to traditional Indigenous owners, and then lease it back for 99 years under a joint management plan.
With plans to circulate petitions, Save Our Parks campaigner Francoises Builder says there is plenty of opposition to any single group owning parks.
"Parks are free, they are for everybody, so why handing it to a group of people and then leasing it back with taxpayers' money for a million dollars a year?"
"And it is true when you are giving away for example Bondi Beach it's exactly the same thing, we have nothing else to go to."

Infrastructure costs hold up Ord irrigation scheme
Infrastructure costs are the latest hurdle for expansion plans in the nation's biggest irrigation scheme, in Western Australia's far north.
Native title settlement last October raised hopes of a quick go-ahead for Ord Stage 2 but six months on there is still no movement.
The scheme would more than double the existing irrigation area in WA, with more than 30,000 hectares earmarked for development.
WA's Minister for Agriculture and Food Kim Chance says a decision is imminent, but it is a matter of deciding how much should be paid for roads, power and irrigation works.

WA to reap rewards after Brazil iron deal
Western Australia's economy looks set for further growth, with Brazil, the world's largest iron ore producer, negotiating a better-than-expected price hike.
The market had tipped a rise in the iron ore price of between 10 and 15 per cent, instead, it will go up 19 per cent.
The deal between Brazil's CVRD and German steel-maker ThyssenKrupp sets the scene for increased iron prices for WA miners.
ANZ Bank commodity analyst Andrew Harrington says it also means more royalties for government coffers.
"The higher the price the higher the volume, will inevitably lead to higher tax revenues for the Government," he said.
"Earlier in the year ABARE was forecasting that iron ore would become the highest exporter earner for the country.

Tasmania set for rail upgrade
Toll's successful takeover of transport company Patrick has paved the way for a multi-million dollar rail upgrade in Tasmania.
Pacific National, which is jointly owned by the two companies, threatened to stop carting container freight by rail last year, unless state and federal governments helped to improve infrastructure.
After months of stalled negotiations, Pacific National has now agreed to invest $38 million in new rolling stock, while the governments will provide $118 million for infrastructure.
Tasmanian Minister for Infrastructure Jim Cox hopes industry will also support a better rail service.

Draft dairy report recommends support for GM crops
The dairy industry has been embarrassed by the leaking of a draft report that recommends it join other agricultural industries in supporting genetically modified (GM) crops.
Until now state governments have had the backing of the dairy industry in banning commercial GM crops.
The draft report was commissioned by the Australian Dairy Industry Council (ADIC) and was not due to be released until much later this year.
Policy director with Australian Dairy Farmers, Robert Poole, says the current policy was written seven years ago, and was due for review.
"Had we not had it happen where it's now become public we would have certainly gone to the point where we would have consulted widely especially with dairy farmers and with dairy companies, although they're part of the ADIC process and obviously ultimately governments as well," he said.
Mr Poole says it is a draft report and not industry policy.
Meanwhile a leading plant breeder says the dairy industry would save millions of dollars, if it embraced GM crops.
Viruses in pastures such as white clover cost the industry $110 million a year, but a virus-resistant clover could be on-farm by 2009.
Research director Professor German Spangenberg says that is just one reason for introducing genetically modified technology.

Bush sees no need for US inquiry into AWB
President George W Bush does not appear to think there will be need for a US inquiry into AWB, despite pressure from domestic farm groups and some senators.
The President has expressed confident in the Australian Government's ability to investigate the kickbacks scandal, during a visit to Washington by Prime Minister John Howard.
Mr Bush praised Howard for his free trade efforts, and dodged questions about the AWB, saying Australia was conducting its own investigation into the UN oil-for-food scandal, and Mr Bush looked forward to seeing the results.
At the US Capitol, Mr Howard told Senate leaders he understood the difficulty surrounding the Australia-US free trade agreement.
"I know that things of that kind always create some difficult domestic judgments and considerations ... and, I'm very grateful that it received such strong support," he said.

Court rules against AWB over 'apology' document
A Federal Court judge has ruled against wheat exporter AWB, in its fight to keep a so-called apology document confidential.
The document was prepared on the advice of US-based public relations consultant, and was mistakenly included in evidence AWB tendered to the Cole inquiry.
Justice Neil Young took just 10 minutes to rule, AWB had no claim for legal professional privilege, and rejected the company's efforts to keep the document confidential.
Justice Young also found Commissioner Cole had every right to rule on the legal status of the document, a point disputed by AWB.

Burgess makes case to lead NFF
No surprises and no big policy changes is how prospective National Farmers' Federation (NFF) boss Allan Burgess, says he will lead the organisation if elected president.
Mr Burgess, NFF's trade representative, will contest next month's leadership ballot against former Meat and Livestock Australia boss David Crombie.
The Victorian says making sure farmers get a fair price for their produce and maintain a good relationship with urban Australia are key issues.
He says bringing Western Australia and South Australia back into the NFF fold is also high on his list of priorities.
"At the very highest priority for Allan Burgess in any organisation he's ever been a part of has been about getting a collective view," he said.
"In my experience farm organisations only work well when you can come to one consensus.

Inquiry releases AWB apology
The head of the Oil for Food Inquiry, Commissioner Terence Cole has just released the apology document, prepared between AWB, company lawyers and US public relations consultant Dr Peter Sandman.
The document, drafted by former MD Andrew Lindberg, states that AWB accepts in paying money for inland transportation and after sales service, it paid money to the Iraq government in contravention of the UN sanctions.
The document also states that although there were warning signs, AWB did not challenge the payments and for this they are truly sorry, and deeply regrets any damage this may have caused to Australia's trading reputation, the Australian Government or the United Nations.
The statement admits they failed to consider the implications of UN sanctions, and should have had their own internal systems of checks and balances to stop any abuse of the oil for food program.
It concludes there is no excuse for what happened, that the company simply should have done better, and that Mr Lindberg is deeply sorry that it did not.
AWB had decided not to release the document, but it was mistakenly tendered to the Cole Inquiry, along with other AWB evidence.

Live trade to Egypt may re-start soon
The Federal Government has confirmed it is working on a plan which could see the livestock export trade to Egypt reopen in a matter of weeks.
The trade to Egypt was banned in February when the 60 Minutes program aired footage showing animals being treated outside industry standards.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says his investigations proved the cattle were not Australian, but he shut the trade because the humane handling of Australian animals could not be guaranteed.
The Minister now says industry is forming a plan which will animals treated better.
"There may well be some Australian stockmen or vets or locally employed and trusted staff," he said.
But RSPCA National President Hugh Wirth says more than increased supervision is needed.
"You can do all the supervising you like, it's not going to change the fact that the abattoir workers have a great deal of difficulty dealing with Australian cattle."
Around 12,000 head of cattle were exported to Egypt last year worth around $10 million.
The cattle industry says the findings of a new report add weight to the argument to resume the live cattle trade with Egypt, with appropriate monitoring.
Cameron Hall from Livecorp says the report has found Australia has the highest animal welfare standards in the world.
"There needs to be appropriate systems and appropriate monitoring to ensure some of the reasons that the trade was halted and suspended in the first place, cannot continue and particularly we can guarantee levels of assurance that the animals that we market into those countries are processed and handled with a level of care that we would expect," he said.
The report was commissioned by Livecorp and Meat and Livestock Australia.
The first shipment of live cattle out of the far north Queensland city of Townsville in three years is due to leave at the weekend.

Boom time for feedlots
Strong export demand and the ongoing drought have pushed the feedlot sector to record heights.
Australia now has just under 900,000 head of cattle on feed, with Queensland and Western Australia recording the biggest jumps.
But Malcolm Foster from the Lotfeeders Association has sounded a note of caution.
He says the United States could be back supplying beef into Japan and Korea as early as next month, which will provide stiff competition for our grain-fed product.
"It is very good news, but this situation's been going on now for two years," he said.

Report recommends GM grass for dairy cows
The South Australian Dairyfarmers Association says it will support the introduction of genetically modified (GM) pasture grasses if consumers accept them.
A leaked draft report for the Australian Dairy Industry Council recommends introducing GM grass for dairy cows, after research pointing to massive productivity gains from the new technology.
SA association president, David Basham, says the industry needs to do more investigation.
"We need to keep that research going, we need to make sure that if consumers are ready to move on, we are there ready to adopt," he said.
"If the markets are not willing to accept GM products then we as an industry can't accept it and that may be the way it goes."
And there are deeply divided views on GM pastures in Victoria.

Concerns over inferior wool in bales
Concerns have been raised about the growing number of wool bales that have inferior quality wool deliberately hidden in them.
The Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX) says buyers are losing confidence in the quality of Australian wool because of falsely presented bales and a rise in contaminated and unprepared fleeces.
AWEX woolclasser registrar Greg Sawyer says the market slump has seen growers trying to cut corners, but it is turning buyers off altogether.
"We know of mills around the world that have notified AWEX of wools that for arguments sake may have 10-bale line of fleece wool, eight bales are well prepared and the last two bales may be topped up with inferior wool which hasn't been," he said.

NLIS frustration in Tas
Tasmanian cattle producers are frustrated by the state's roll-out of the National Livestock Identification System.
They are still required to use tailtags, as well as the new electronic ear tags, even though the rest of Australia will be tail-tag free from July 1.
Tasmanian NLIS coordinator John Cameron says they need to be able to guarantee trace-back to the last property of origin before tail tags can be removed.
"At the moment there are still a lot of cattle with NLIS tags in their ears that are not registered to the correct property on the database," he said.
"So if they're sent to a saleyard or abattoir the database doesn't have the correct information about where they are.

Govt assesses drought in NSW
The ongoing impact of the drought is being assessed first hand in New South Wales by Federal Government assessors.
The National Rural Advisory Council has embarked on an extensive tour of areas coming to the end of exceptional circumstances drought relief.
Sheep specialist Doug Alcock has helped the council to understand the severity of the drought from Canberra south to the Alpine region.
"Water is the biggest issue in terms of the effort and money that's been put into infrastructure in terms of tanks and new bores and reticulation systems," he said.
"People running polypipe anything up to a couple of kilometres just to get water into paddocks, it's very expensive and heartbreaking in country that nobody has any living memory of ever going dry some of the springs."
Coastal farmers in the region are also being hit hard by drought.

Sick sheep seek out healthy food: research
Scientists have known for a long time that sheep seek out foods to gather the nutrients they need, but new research suggests they can choose foods to cure illness.
CSIRO Livestock Industries in Western Australia believe sick sheep will search for plants that make them better.
It is conducting a trial in WA's wheatbelt to work out which plants are eaten by sheep to improve their health and production levels.
Senior research scientist Dr Dean Revell says down the track, farmers might even be able to incorporate "medicinal paddocks" into their farm management.
"Maybe they have to have a continual exposure to these, so they have to be incorporated into the grazing base, the feed base," he said.
"The former option is more attractive, where we can set up and manage a separate paddock and take them there when needed.

WA imposes ban to stop virus
Western Australia has banned any plant material from the east which could host the yellow leaf curl virus.
The virus was found in tomato crops near Brisbane and Bundaberg last month.

Fiji looks to dairying
Fiji is hoping for a boom in its dairy industry, as its dominant sugar industry faces a downturn.
A delegation has been touring dairy farms in Victoria this week to investigate alternative ways of farming.
Until recently the European Union has given preferential market treatment to Fijian sugar, but with an EU restructure, it is becoming hard for sugar growers to stay in business.
Economist with the Fijian Ministry of Agriculture Waisiici Gonemaituba thinks favourable rainfall conditions will be an advantage for dairy farmers.
"We get rain nearly every two days which is good for pasture production and the dairy industry as a whole," he said.

Landcare to honour Farley
The Australian Landcare Council plans to pay tribute to co-founder Rick Farley by an annual award in his honour.
A former head of the National Farmers Federation, Mr Farley, as also instrumental in establishing the Landcare movement.
He died on Saturday.
Landcare chairman Bobbie Brazil says the award will honour Mr Farley's work and vision.

Wimmera farmers say AWB should have released apology letter sooner
Wheat growers say AWB could have taken the heat of the accusations it had paid kickbacks to the former Iraqi Government, by publishing a letter of apology before the Oil for Food Inquiry.
The Inquiry yesterday released a document prepared by former AWB managing director Andrew Lindberg in December, which said the company was truly sorry it did not challenge the payments, despite warning signs, and it should have done better.
Farmers in Victoria's Wimmera region say by trying to block the letter's release through the Federal Court, AWB has only raised further questions about what it was trying to hide.
"I would have believed that if it had have been presenter prior to the Cole Inquiry it may have defused quite a lot of the heat and argument within the Cole Inquiry itself," one farmer said.
"In hindsight AWB should have published a very similar letter, if not the same letter early on in the piece and the witch-hunt might not have gone on to the extent that it has," another farmer said.
A rural public relations consultant agrees that the apology document should have been released earlier.
Mark Paterson from Currie Communications says it would have made a big difference to AWB's reputation.
"Looking at the draft statement of contrition, it's an excellent letter of apology," he said.
"Yes it admits guilt, but what it shows is that AWB is human, and at no point at any time during this whole process have they demonstrated any humility at all."
Meanwhile, eight wheat exporters, including Cargill, Glencorp and AWB have bid for the latest tender to supply 3 million tonnes of wheat to India.
AWB has confirmed it will make an offer to supply 1.2 million tonnes of the contract, while the other companies are believed to have offered for smaller amounts.

States debate Murray River funding allocation
There has finally been some progress in efforts to establish a national water trading system.
The eastern states appear to be trying to settle their differences over the future of water at a meeting of the Murray Darling Ministerial Council in Melbourne.
The council is also debating how to carve up an extra $500 million in federal funding to improve the environmental health of the Murray River.
While there is yet to be a national agreement on how water may be bought back by government into the Murray system, the states are making some progress of their own.
Victoria and NSW have reached an in-principle deal to trade water which may be up and running by the end of the year.
While the details of exit fees and other costs are yet to be worked out, both states have agreed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission should review any deal to make sure it is fair for all sides.
Victoria and South Australia had already an agreement on water trading prior to today's meeting.
Doug Miell from the New South Wales Irrigators Council, says the state has managed to convince Victoria and South Australia of the merits of a system of tagged trading.
"We've got the water that Victoria and South Australia have really got their eyes on, so it's simply a case of he who has the gold makes the rules," he said.

Irrigator groups oppose Snowy Hydro sale
Key irrigator groups in southern New South Wales have withdrawn their support for the sale of the Snowy Hydro electric scheme.
They are worried about a planned 10 per cent cap on individual shareholdings after the company is sold by the federal, New South Wales and Victorian governments.
George Warne from Murray Irrigation says the proposed safeguards are not enough to protect the business from an international takeover.
"I think one of the really big issues is the fact that Australia's largest single stored water resources - the Snowy Hydro scheme and its operation and the timing of releases and the power that is generated from - it is going to leave government ownership and go into private hands," he said.
"We thought they would dissipate that effect by having a maximum cap of 5 per cent or 10 per cent that any one party could own.

Australia to lead climate change deal negotiations
Australia will lead negotiations on a new international climate change deal to replace the Kyoto protocol which is due to expire in 2012.
The framework, to be co-developed with Germany and South Africa, will apply to almost 200 countries.
Mick Keogh from the Australian Farm Institute says farmers have led the way in reducing greenhouse emissions and should not be further penalised.
He says federal and state governments cannot take credit for work largely undertaken by farmers.
"There is only one sector of the Australian economy that's made a very significant contribution to the reduction in the growth of Australia's greenhouse emissions and that is the farm sector," he said.

Seven-day forecasts now available to regional areas
Farmers across Australia can now access seven-day forecasts from the weather bureau, as well as the traditional four-day advice.
Week-long forecasts have been available to city dwellers for some time, but they have now been rolled out on a trial basis at 600 weather sites around Australia, including regional areas.
Anne Farrell from the Bureau of Meteorology in Brisbane says the forecasts have some shortcomings, but will be accurate for a range of factors.
"Temperature-wise I think the performance is generally pretty good," she said.
"Rainfall-wise there's still a lot of work to be done to try and get higher reliability in that as we go further ahead in that seven-day outlook.
"But it's at the point that we think that there's sufficient skill in that, that its worth putting it out there for the public to make use of."
The seven-day forecasts will be available free of charge through a website called Australian

Rio Tinto sets new iron ore price benchmark
Mining giant Rio Tinto has confirmed it will receive 19 per cent more this year for iron ore shipped from WA, making it the benchmark price for other deals.
The deal between Japanese steel mills and Rio Tinto closely follows a similar deal between Germany and Brazil.

Research centres' economic benefits to be evaluated
Australia's Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) are under review again.
The CRCs are partnerships between government, industry and scientific institutes, undertaking research and development.
To ensure future funding, the economic benefits of individual programs and centres will now be evaluated but Tony Staley from the CRC Association says it is hard to estimate the value of agricultural research.
"And happily the governments are prepared to fund the next part of this work to endeavour to get a real handle, as much as you can, on those cases where you've got thousands of farmers, thousands of small businesses implementing practices, that have been ... recommended and adopted by many many thousands of people and it's very very hard to measure," he said.
Meanwhile there are calls to establish a co-operative research centre for small farms.
North west Victorian horticulturalist Jim Belbin says properties of between 10 and 30 acres are struggling to compete against much larger farms.
He believes an organisation should examine which crops could be sustainably farmed on smaller holdings of land.
"I am certain that there are crops that require intensive farming that are suitable to small holdings," he said.

Pyrethrum prices cut
Tasmanian crop farmers have been dealt another blow, a cut in pyrethrum prices.
Tasmania is the world's second largest producer of the daisy, which is used to make natural insecticide.
Growers group chairman Scott Langton says the 5 per cent price cut has been attributed to a world oversupply and is likely to halt further development.
"What we're really after is just a fair and equitable return so that we can still maintain forward advancement in technology so that we're ready to take up new technology that comes on," he said.

NSW Govt moves to recruit UK nurses
More overseas trained nurses will soon be hitting Australia's shores, this time from the UK.
The New South Wales Government has adopted a recruitment program similar to one operating in Queensland.
A team is heading to the UK next week to hire 400 nurses, with another 600 being sought from Canada and other parts of Europe.
Dr Ross Maxwell from the Rural Doctors Association says it is easier to check the qualifications rather than those of health professionals from Africa or India.
However he says this is not discrimination.
"I would hope that's not the case and I believe that there are sound reasons to target health professionals where you can be confident of their training," he said.

Thousands expected to flock to Fred's Show
The first agricultural show of the year in the Top End is expected to attract 30,000 people through the gates this weekend.
Equestrian events are already under way south of Darwin at the four-day Fred's Pass Rural Show.
Last year 29,500 walked through the gates of the showgrounds, which are nestled amongst five acre rural blocks on Darwin City's southern outskirts.
And this year, a steer auction is being held for the first time and the Territory's Cowboys Association is hoping to draw big crowds to the two days of rodeo.
The hay-stacking event is one of the most competitive and the Tasmanian woodchoppers will showcase their talents for the 18th time.

Buddhist monks connect with Indigenous community
A group of Buddhist monks are finding solace in a far north Western Australian Indigenous community famous for its rock art.
An Indian guru and her nine disciples have been meditating on the pristine Mitchell Plateau of the north Kimberley.
And Aboriginal youth from the local Candiwall community made such an impression that they have been invited to India.
Archaeologist Lee Scott Virtue led the group and says the connection with land was obvious,

Threatened squirrel gilder found in south-east SA
A mammal, similar to a sugar glider, has been found for the first time in the south-east of South Australia.
The squirrel glider is a threatened species more commonly found in western Victorian woodlands and along the eastern seaboard.
SA Department of Environment ecologist Dan Harley says the discovery was made by a researcher at the Museum of South Australia, who thought she was looking at a collection of sugar gliders.
"When she got to this handful of specimens from the Bordertown area, she got some really weird results and scratched her head and couldn't work out what was going on," he said.

Fijians set sights on dairy industry
Fiji is hoping for a boom in its dairy industry, as its dominant sugar industry faces a downturn.
A delegation has been touring dairy farms in Victoria this week to investigate alternative ways of farming .
Until recently the European Union has given preferential market treatment to Fijian sugar but with an EU restructure, it is becoming hard for sugar growers to stay in business.
Economist with the Fijian Ministry of Agriculture Waisiici Gonemaituba thinks favourable rainfall conditions will be an advantage for dairy farmers.
"We get rain nearly every two days which is good for pasture production and the dairy industry as a whole," he said.

Hay export market strong
Australia's hay exports have reached record levels with stronger demand from Japan, Korea and Taiwan.
Murray Smith, from exporting company Balco Australia, says last year exports were valued at more than $200 million.
He says Australia's high quality product is highly sought after and the market is as strong as he has ever seen it.
"If we look at our exports to seasonally adjusted year end of November 05, I think we're up to 685,000 tonnes being exported out of Australia of cereal hay and straw and that's a record as far as I'm concerned," he said.

Birdsville Track pastoralists face continuing drought
After battling seven years of drought pastoralists on the Birdsville Track in South Australia are reaching breaking point.
Some have not had a decent drop of rain since July last year, forcing them to either sell or agist most of their cattle interstate.
Shane Oldfield from Clayton Station says this is the worst he has ever seen it:
"We always get drought's in this country you know two, three years, four years is a real bad one - this is the daddy of them all," he said.

Iraq wheat deal collapses
A deal to sell 350,000 tonnes of Australian wheat to Iraq is off.
The sale was brokered by the consortium Wheat Australia after Iraq announced it would no longer do business with AWB.
The consortium involving ABB, Graincorp and CBH is blaming increased demands from the Iraqi Grains Board although it will not specify what they were.
It has rejected suggestions its inexperience in Iraq was a factor or because the wheat came from AWB's national pool.
Spokesman Rhys Ainsworth says the sale was not in the best interests of wheat growers.
"There were a couple of commercial issues that Wheat Australia, given that Wheat Australia are negotiating on behalf of Australian wheat growers, weren't able to agree to and unfortunately we weren't able to broker a deal over the last eight to 10 weeks despite what have been very positive discussions," he said.
"We're disappointed for Australian wheat growers.
"Wheat Australia came together following the efforts of the Government to secure this opportunity.
"Certainly several of the areas that we weren't able to reach agreement on weren't what you'd call common I suppose."
AWB, which has veto rights over export deals, says it will reconsider whether other companies can tackle the Iraq market.

Private member's bill
Meanwhile Liberal MP Wilson Tuckey says he will introduce a private member's bill to Parliament to remove AWB's ability to veto other companies from exporting wheat, if the Government does not.
Mr Tuckey says it was highly predictable a deal would not be reached because the wheat wasn't sold at 'arms-length' from AWB.
He says he will talk to the Australian Grain Exporters Association today to encourage its members to lodge wheat export applications for Iraq.
But he says the Government must also act to reduce AWB's power.
"It's now necessary that the Government in its ambition to ensure that the trade is maintained to go to Brooks Grain or one of the, as some refer to them, the foreign devils, be given every opportunity to see if they can stitch up a deal and it should be the Government's, if necessary, urgent legislation to make sure that deliveries can be obtained," he said.

AWB earnings
Despite a rocky few months, AWB is expected to post good half year earnings this week on the back of a solid wheat harvest.
Analysts say the recent poor share price is due to speculation about the future of the single desk and not the company's performance.
There are also reports today that a major management shake-up could be announced, although the company is not commenting.
Commsec analyst Grant Saligari says those rumours have not been put to the market.
"There's been nothing flagged to us by the company at this stage that they will, but that's a possibility," he said.
"The underlying results should still be reasonably robust. There's likely to be a number of one-off costs associated with the Cole inquiry, they'll certainly impact the result.
"It's likely to be higher than the originally flagged cost, as long as the inquiry goes on, I guess they'll continue to have those one-offs."
In another development AWB is gaining a foothold in the dairy sector, announcing a deal between its Landmark company and New Zealand processor Fonterra.

Plan to deliver rural broadband may be dumped
Telstra has confirmed it is considering dumping a project to connect broadband Internet to thousands of country homes.
The plan involves Extel technology, which boosts the power of telephone exchanges by up to 20 kilometres.
But Telstra is concerned that rival companies will be able to use the technology.
Spokeswoman Liz Jurman says there are also other problems with the rollout of Extel and the company is now looking at alternative ways of delivering broadband to rural and remote areas.
"The extender can't be used on individual customers you need to provide it where there are clusters of demand, so obviously that depends on customer demand, so we haven't yet made a final decision on that product," she said.
"And it's important to understand this device is not the be all and end all for providing ADSL to customers.

US cattlemen losing confidence in Japanese market
The US-based National Cattlemen's Beef Association says it is losing confidence in the Japanese market with its refusal to set a timetable to reopen the beef trade.
Spokesman Jay Truitt says the US has done all it can to reassure Japan that American beef is safe.
But Japanese authorities now want to do their own inspections of US meatworks after a prohibited shipment, including spinal bones, made it to Japan in January.
While he is still hoping for the market to reopen soon, Mr Truitt says Japan is a less reliable market for US producers.
"Our focus in the future is going to be more towards Korea, existing markets like Mexico and Canada, frankly, which is the fourth largest existing market for the United States and other countries around the Pacific rim," he said.
Despite the uncertainty, some reports suggest Japan could resume imports of US beef in July.
Following talks last week, Japanese experts have reportedly told US authorities they are "basically content" with measures to protect shipments from mad cow disease.
Meat and Livestock Australia's regional manager in Tokyo Samantha Jamieson says the July start date is sooner the expected but should not cause alarm for Australian producers.

Demand for bananas prompts desperate measures
Competition to find enough bananas is heating up in New South Wales as prices continue to hover well over $100 a carton.
Before cyclone Larry wiped out the north Queensland crop, growers in New South Wales were receiving under $10 a carton.
Coffs Harbour grower Mick Gentle says growers are receiving constant phone calls from agents looking for more fruit and one has even bought a local plantation to ensure supply.

Chinese currency may push wool higher
The wool market is hoping for further gains this week, boosted by a re-evaluation of the Chinese currency.
The value of the yuan has been strengthened against the US dollar and wool market analysts say it is already being felt in Australia.
The eastern market indicator rose 16 cents last week to close at 729 cents a kilogram clean.
Landmark's Phil Speers says with the Chinese buying around 60 per cent of Australia's total clip, there could be further price rises.
"This obviously makes their currency more competitive against the Australian currency which is going to make it easier for them to come in and buy our wools," he said.

Water deal will bring benefits, says commission chief
The head of the Murray Darling Basin Commission is defending the impact of the new interstate water trading agreement.
Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia have signed a deal to trade water across state borders, while the Federal Government has signalled its interest in buying water for the environment.
Chief executive Wendy Craik says while there are concerns about the social impact of water being sold out of communities, there are other benefits as well.
"Yes, when water leaves an area often you know there may be an immediate impact and quite often yes they're not positive but often new enterprises arise up in those areas from where the water's gone because people have money that they didn't otherwise have from selling their water entitlement," she said.

WA farmers anxious for rain
Graingrowers in Western Australia are anxiously waiting for some substantial rainfall to come out of a cold front expected to pass through in the next two days.
Along with many farmers in the east, growing in the northern agricultural regions have been dry sowing since March and are now starting to worry about the impact of the ongoing dry.
CSIRO plant scientist John Passioura says farmers underestimate how strong seeds really are.
"If you have a false start and you get a bit of rain and the seed starts to swell up and so and it's done all of the getting the machinery ready to go, the biochemical machinery, then, it will skip that phase when you get the next good rain," he said.

Demand for alpaca wool increasing
If you have got an alpaca or two running around the backyard, you are being urged to shear it and sell the fleece.
The industry's marketing body says there has been a big jump in demand for alpaca fibre which cannot be met.
John Bentley, from the Australian Alpaca Association, says because the animals are valued as pets, or guard animals, there is less focus on their fleece.
"The value is still highly in the animal, which tends to make the fleece at this point in time, more a by-product, but we do have to get the product out there to the public, get them familiar with alpaca," he said.

Sexy smells may help trap toads
Bottling up cane toads' sexual odours is the latest left-field idea to trap the noxious pest.
The new research builds on a discovery that the pheromones excreted by a native male frog attracts female frogs at large.
Dr Mike Tyler from the University of Adelaide says they are hoping cane toad smells will have a similar pulling power.
"If it's an attractant we would be able to attract perhaps females in such numbers that instead of having to go around and pick up one here and one there, we might be able to attract them together," he said.

Govt optimistic contract changes could save wheat deal
The Federal Government says a 350,000 tonne wheat deal between Australia and Iraq could be salvaged.
Yesterday, the Wheat Australia consortium said it had failed to come to terms with Iraq and negotiations for the $90 million deal were over.
But Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran believes Iraq is considering removing a clause in the contract which Wheat Australia had found unacceptable.
"Negotiations are not necessarily over," he said. "Wheat Australia is working very hard in the interests of growers to complete the sale."
"They've taken a strong line in regard to one particular clause, which they believe would disadvantage commercially Australian growers and that's entirely proper and the right thing for them to do, and it may well be that the Iraqi side is now reconsidering they're insistence in the insertion of that particular clause."
But wheat growers in Victoria say they are not surprised the deal has stalled.
While some say the contract tender should be opened to other companies, others believe it shows the single desk is the only successful system.
"The world wheat market is the highest it has been for five years. We've got people out there wanting to pay a good price for our wheat yet we are not able to fix these deals," one wheat grower said.

Wheat futures near all-time highs
A global share market fall in mineral and energy stocks is having unexpected benefits for wheat prices, with futures markets at or near all-time highs.
Analysts say speculative funds appear to be pouring money into wheat, as they turn away from oil, gold and copper.
Wheat prices on the Chicago Futures Exchange rose again overnight, to around $AUD220 per tonne.
Brett Stevenson, from Market Check, says even better prices are being offered for wheat for March 2008 and 2009, and at around $250 a tonne, they are just below the 1995 record.
"We are faced for the first time a situation where the forward prices three years in the future are at extraordinarily high levels, nearly records," Mr Brett Stevenson said.
"We have got massive amounts of money invested into the metals. We think some of that money maybe coming in to the soft commodity funds in other words, wheat, you know, grains, that sort of thing.

Weaker price for Indian wheat deal
Despite a boom in wheat futures and the lowest global wheat stocks in 25 years, Australian farmers are not getting top grain prices this season.
In the latest deal, Australia is believed to have offered to sell wheat to India at a much lower price than its major competitors.
Grains analyst Malcolm Bartholomaeus says that is largely due to the practise of selling each year's stocks, before the next season's harvest.
"While it may be tempting to hold wheat back against this rising market and achieve higher prices later in the year, the practise in Australia has really been to clear each crop before the next one comes in basically at whatever price," he said.
"The storage and handling companies and growers get pretty cranky if we go into the next harvest with stocks still being held in the system and I guess if AWB think that to get rid of the wheat they need to push it out at lower prices, then that's what they're doing."

Continuing bear market may lead to nervous investors
The Australian Stock Exchange has begun trading marginally weaker, despite stronger commodity prices on the London Metal Exchange overnight.
In 10 days the local market has dropped $80 billion, reacting to weakening metal prices.
Although many analysts say the market needed a correction, Hartleys resource expert Rob Brierley says investors will start to get nervous if this bear market continues.
"Probably another week of this and people would be extremely worried," he said.

Govt, Telstra assurances sought for 3G rollout
The Federal Government is under pressure to regulate the rollout of Telstra's new 3G mobile phone network, to make sure rural Australia is not disadvantaged when the current CDMA service is shutdown.
Telstra has promised it will not turn-off CDMA before January 2008, even if the 3G network has reached equivalent coverage before then.
But in Senate Estimates hearings yesterday National Party Senator Fiona Nash told Telstra representatives, regional areas deserve more than just assurances from the phone company.
"But what if I just take you back to the Extel example and early on in the desk top study and the work that had been done in terms on what could be rolled out technologically, and now it seems that, 'oops that wasn't quite right'? What I'm trying to make sure for those people that live out in regional Australia that we don't get to the end of the rollout and hear from Telstra again, 'oops we didn't get that quite right'."

Road cuts 'add to Wadeye violence'
Poor road infrastructure is said to have contributed to ongoing violence within the Northern Territory's largest Indigenous community.
Flooding cuts off the community of Wadeye for six months of every year and with only sea or air access it is hard for police to reach.
At least four homes have been destroyed during violence in recent days.
About 100 residents have fled and are camping in tents beside the Port Keats Road in the lower Daly region.
Fifty people are stranded at the Daly River Crossing.
Mango farmer Gary Higgins says they are being forced to camp at his front gate.
"Yesterday when we came in there was about 30 or 40 people all at our front gate," he said.
"There is a big rock bar there and they actually use that from there to get across into the community opposite.
"They can only get their vehicles to our front gate.

FMG considers rail access appeal
A bid by the Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) to use a BHP Billiton railway in Western Australia's Pilbara has failed.
While the line is owned by the mining giant, FMG has argued it should be allowed access to take advantage of the resources boom, instead of having to build another railway.
After years of debate, Treasurer Peter Costello was expected to make an announcement on the proposal yesterday but the deadline passed without comment.
FMG's Julian Tapp says the company is looking at how it might appeal the decision, which is a blow for all small iron ore companies in the region.
"We've been doing this not just for ourselves, but for general public interest," he said.

Drought-hit farmers hope for transport subsidies
The grip of the drought is tightening in New South Wales.
The latest figures show nearly two-thirds of the state is drought declared, and much of the rest is marginal.
Only 10 per cent of the state is considered satisfactory.
State Primary Industries Minister Ian Macdonald has spent the morning discussing the deteriorating conditions with his colleagues in Cabinet.

Roma saleyard replaces stock ID equipment
Australia's biggest saleyard is changing its national livestock identification equipment but management denies that is because it is not efficient.
Run-through scanners were introduced at Roma in southern Queensland in July last year, to comply with the new animal traceback laws.
Since there there have been complaints of time delays and ongoing debate over whether the equipment or the agents are to blame.
Rob Loughnan, from the saleyard's board, says delays are an issue.
But he says the main reason for the change is because the system cannot easily separate an individual beat from a herd.
"The market research is telling us that very soon the buyers will be wanting to know if there is an animal in a particular pen that is not lifetime traceable and that's not going to suit their requirements and that's going to have to be highlighted," he said.

Study to consider wine industry's future
Increased domestic and international competition has prompted a new study into the future direction of the wine industry.
The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and the Winemakers Federation of Australia are conducting the state of the industry study, which is to be released next year.
But the report will not offer short-term solutions for growers unable to sell their grapes.
The federation's Dominic Nolan says it is to protect the long-term future of the wine industry, and is not a knee-jerk reaction to the grape glut.
"The decisions that we make about planting today really has an impact in five years' time or beyond," he said.
"What we're looking at is very much a strategic document, we're talking what's going to happen in the next 10 to 20 years.

Vet's braham fertility research honoured
The highest accolade in veterinary science has been awarded to a man partly responsible for the success of brahman cattle in northern Australia.
Dr Keith Entwistle has been awarded the Gilruth Prize at the Australian Veterinary Association's annual conference in Hobart this week.
He says years of research with his colleagues helped to solve problems with cow and bull fertility, when the brahman breed was first introduced.
"A lot of the research that we did over the last 30 years has certainly contributed to the wider use of the brahman," he said.

AWB profit rises despite scandal
Despite the oil-for-food inquiry and a sliding share price, wheat handler AWB has delivered a strong half-year result.
AWB admits it is in a difficult operating environment but its profit is up 5 per cent to $86 million before tax.
Profits have been boosted by a strong performance from the national pool, as well as business outside the wheat trade.
The Cole inquiry has cost almost $10 million so far.
The final bill is expected to total $18 million, as long as there are no extensions.
While happy with the returns, chairman Brendan Stewart says the company is determined to restore its reputation.
"I think what this demonstrates is that while we're in challenging times, that AWB is a very resilient business and we've got a good foundation for the future," Mr Stewart said.
Mr Stewart has reaffirmed the company's plans to separate AWB Limited from its international export arm.
"This is a clear direction from the board that we are prepared to make changes that deliver security and certainty to the single desk," he said.
AWB's results also divulge a payout worth more than $1 million to former managing director Andrew Lindberg.
Mr Stewart has refused to confirm any planned changes to management until after the Cole inquiry hands down its findings. 

New documents
The Cole inquiry will be able to scrutinise new documents from AWB, including the wheat exporter's own internal investigation into Iraqi kickback allegations.
The Federal Government has agreed to change the Royal Commissions Act after a request from Commissioner Terence Cole.
The changes will come into effect from June 13 and hearing are expected to be resumed the following week.

Independent probe
Meanwhile, a key US Senator on farm issues is asking for an independent investigation of AWB's kickbacks and the failure of US authorities in that country to do anything about it.
US Senator Tom Harkin is asking the independent inspector-generals of the US Agriculture and State Departments to investigate the AWB and why the Bush Administration has brushed aside similar requests.
Senator Harkin's spokesman Dave Townsend says what happened to the $200 million in alleged AWB kickbacks is a key issue.
"Prior to the fall, those kickbacks were going to Saddam Hussein," he said.
"While Hussein is no longer in power, Senator Harkin would like to know where that money was going ... and why, at the time, ... we weren't about to figure out that those contracts still contained kickbacks."
Mr Townsend says Senator Harkin wants the $220 million recovered and returned to the Iraqi people. 

Wheat sales
The scandal is continuing to affect Australia's wheat trade with Iraq.
Despite Federal Government speculation that a $90 million deal could be salvaged, a member of the consortium negotiating the deal says it has definitely failed.
Graincorp, ABB Grain and Western Australia-based CBH have been attempting to deliver $350,000 tonnes of wheat but contractual problems have stalled the deal.

WA lifts wheat import ban
Wheat varieties from the eastern states will be allowed back into Western Australia, with the lifting of a ban on imports.
The restriction has been in place since December to try to prevent the introduction of wheat streak mosaic virus.

Storm season prediction lifts oil price
The price of a barrel of crude oil has gone up again overnight, after the United States' weather forecaster predicted an above-average storm season in the Gulf of Mexico.
Twenty per cent of the gulf's oil facilities are still off-line from last season.
ANZ Bank commodity analyst Andrew Harrington says it is the 11th above-average cyclone season in a row, and is raising questions about the effects of climate change.
"Another above-average season doesn't say much when the average is creeping upwards," he said.
"I guess it's kind of ironic when fossil fuel is driving the climate change and then you have climate change hammering fossil fuel supplies."

Vets push for foreign abattoir audits
The Australian Veterinary Association wants a grading system for overseas abattoirs, to better manage the welfare of exported livestock.
National president Dr Matt Makin says the treatment of Australian animals once they are unloaded in overseas ports is becoming an increasingly contentious part of the trade.
Cattle exports to Egypt were suspended earlier this year, after mistreatment concerns were raised.
Dr Makin says the Australian industry needs to take a greater role in managing animal welfare, not just in the lead up to and during export.
"We've been in heavy discussions with industry and with the Government to push the concept of facility audits overseas," he said.

Australians to train Malaysian abattoir staff
There is expected to be improved animal welfare standards at new cattle abattoir and training centre being built in Australia's second largest live export market, Sabah in Malaysia.
The facility is expected to process up to 10,000 cattle from the Northern Territory.
Robert McFarlane, from the Department of Primary Industries, says it will be built to Australian standards.
"They will hopefully be able to processing, 70 or 80 or anything up to 100 a day if they want to, in due time," he said.
"The object is to train people and then we step back and allow them to carry on training they're own people.

Abetz urges cooperation in illegal fishing fight
Australia is calling for a stronger global effort to combat illegal fishing.
Signatories to a United Nations agreement on fishing are meeting in New York to debate how to tackle the problem.
The UN says the world fishing fleet is two-and-a-half times above sustainable levels, and super vessels from countries like China and Indonesia are operating outside international law.
Australia's Fisheries Minister, Senator Eric Abetz, says more cooperation is needed to stop rampant illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, which is decimating stocks.
"We see the agreement as very important but we now are getting to ensuring that it is properly implemented," he said.

Farmers welcome new transport subsidies
Farmers across New South Wales have welcomed the reintroduction of transport subsidies under a new drought package announced by the State Government.
An extra $5 million will be spent on the movement of stock, fodder and water, and fund drought support workers until the end of the year.
Ninety per cent of the state is now in drought or considered marginal.
New South Wales farmer Jock Laurie says the package goes a long way towards helping producers to get through the current crisis.
"Certainly it is a lot better than it was this time yesterday morning," he said.
"We have got to acknowledge the fact that the Government has moved reasonably quickly on this.
"One thing we want more than anything else is a big shower of rain.

Remote education changes 'exciting'
Major changes have been announced in the Northern Territory to improve the education of students in remote areas.
Existing schools will be merged into a new distance learning service, with new teaching positions and improved technology.
And under a two year trial, the Katherine School of the Air will also offer classes to up to year nine.
Deidre White of Narwietooma Station, north west of Alice Springs, is hoping the trial will be rolled out across the Territory.
"Parents were really worried about losing our year sevens because our schools go from preschool to year sevens, because it's really to send the kids away to boarding school in year six, or at the end of year six, is really they are just little kids basically (aged 11 or 12 years)," she said.

New gold mine set for official opening
Australia's newest gold mine on the edge of the remote Tanami Desert in Western Australia is being opened today by Governor-General Major General Michael Jeffery.
The Coyote gold mine has taken more than a decade to become operational, at a time when gold prices are enjoying record highs.
The gold mine is situated in the remote desert country between Halls Creek and Alice Springs.
Owned by junior resources company, Tanami Gold, the Coyote mine has taken 12 years from the discovery of its first gold deposits to actual mining.
The project was put on hold last year when management decided the price hike in steel and labour would make it unfeasible, though some number crunching and a revised mine plan turned it into a workable option given the record high gold prices.
The company signed an agreement with traditional owners last year, guaranteeing jobs and business opportunities for the Tjurabalan people.

Qld rainforest fruits producer takes out national award
A Queensland producer who grows native rainforest fruits for gourmet foods has been named Australia's first Rural Woman of the Year.
It is the first time the seven state and territory winners have been in line for a national award and Martha Shepherd, from Eumundi on the Sunshine Coast hinterland, says she couldn't have received a higher accolade.
"It's a tremendous honour to be representing rural women, they're such an amazing group to begin with," she said.
"But also to have the opportunity to represent the award nationally and show how significant it is for the careers and the future of the many rural women.

WEA's days may be numbered, boss says
The head of Australia's wheat export watchdog has conceded his agency could be abolished after the oil-for-food Inquiry.
Wheat Export Authority (WEA) chairman Tim Besley told a marathon senate estimates hearing nothing would be the same after the Cole inquiry and pleaded for the role of any future body to be made clearer.
"My plea to anyone who's changing the act is for goodness sake make it clear just precisely what the role of the Wheat Export Authority or its successor body may have," he said.
Senators at the hearing also attacked WEA chief executive Glen Taylor over his pay package, age and qualifications.
Liberal Jeannie Ferris wanted to know why wheat growers paid Mr Taylor $350,000 last year.
"Mr Taylor earns more than the Prime Minister which is quite a remarkable feat I would have thought," he said.

MacNeil resigns over wheat fight
A public fight over a grower levy for the Wheat Export Authority between the Grains Council and the federal Agriculture Minister has claimed a victim.
New South Wales board member Angus MacNeil has resigned from the council, after it attacked Peter McGauran for backflipping on a decision to reduce the levy.
"All the grains industry needs to be pushing in the same direction," he said.
"Unfortunately the grains council is alienating some of the key stakeholders and having difficulty working with them and I just don't think that's my style and I don't think it is going to give us the best outcome.
"I mean there was a fairly public tiff that the Grains Council had with minister McGauran last week on the ABC.
"That is the style of thing that has happened and it is the sort of style I don't appreciate and I don't think is going to achieve us very much."

Bird flu simulation finds response times wanting
While Australia is well equipped to deal with a bird flu outbreak, response times by government agencies need to be improved.
That is the finding of Exercise Eleusis, a three-day simulation of Australia's response to a fictional outbreak of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu, held last year.
Deputy chief veterinary officer, Bob Biddle, says the report card also shows more cooperation is needed between animal and human health agencies, and farmers.
"The report shows that the right decisions were made and with the access to the right sort of information that was available out and about in the exercise scenario but that the committees could have perhaps reached those decisions more rapidly," he said.

Australia's BSE-free status confirmed
Australia's status as a country free from mad cow disease has officially been confirmed by the world's leading animal health agency.

Kraft cream cheese factory moves from Vic to SA
Locals in the northern Victorian town of Strathmerton say they are shocked at a decision by Kraft Foods to move cream cheese production out of the state.
A total of 150 employees will be affected by the restructure over the next two years, with the production being moved to Suttontown, near Mount Gambier, in south-east South Australia.
Former Strathmerton resident and the head of Moira Shire, Gavin Cator, says the news is devastating.
"The impact on the town, it's going to obviously have a huge impact in confidence," he said.
"We believe the dairy industry very has a good future, we have strong dairy industry in the Goulburn Murray valley, and it's disappointing that manufacturing components of it and the value adding we seek locally can't be provided."

Compost access hits mushroom growers
Half of Queensland's mushroom growers say they are facing closure because they can not access locally-produced compost.
The state's largest supplier, Darling Downs Mushrooms, will shut its plant near Toowoomba next month.
It is owned by multinational company Chiquita, and provides more than 20 of Queensland's growers with compost, a vital ingredient for mushroom production.
Withcott producer Bruce White is accusing Chiquita of trying to squeeze small growers out of the market.

Govts told to prepare for loss of industry
Local councils and state governments are being told they should be planning for a potential loss of industry decades before it might occur, if they are to give rural towns a future.
Demographer and social researcher Bernard Salt believes communities need to plan for the worst, and guarantee themselves a range of employment and investment.
He says they should be looking 20 years down the track.

Govt urged to improve appeal of mining towns
With the booming resources sector, WA's Chamber of Minerals and Energy says the State Government needs to do more to make mining towns more attractive places to live.
The chamber says one in five Western Australians are contributing to the $40 million resources sector.
Spokesman Tim Shanahan says mining companies are paying record levels of royalties and it is up to the State Government to ensure workers are benefiting from the boom.
"The State Government is the responsible authority for making making those investments in regional towns," he said.
"We do think there's more to be done in investing in regional communities throughout Western Australia.

Vic Govt considers renewable energy scheme
The Victorian Government is considering a mandatory renewable energy target to encourage wind farm expansion.
The Government says there is no other incentive to grow the renewable energy industry, because the Federal Government will not increase its targets.
Energy Minister Theo Theophanous says power companies will only buy more green energy if they have targets to meet.
"We are still not quite at 10 per cent renewable for the whole country and that's why we are currently looking at the question of whether Victoria should just develop its own renewable energy type scheme, similar to the national MRETS scheme," he said.

Industry welcomes crackdown on illegal fishing
The fishing industry has welcomed new Federal Government legislation cracking down on illegal fishing.
Fisheries Minister Eric Abetz is planning to introduce legislation today that contains a maximum penalty of three years in jail and an $825,000 fine.

Tuna hatchery to be built on Eyre Peninsula
Contruction of the world's first bluefin tuna hatchery has begun on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula.
The new onshore facility at Arno Bay has been developed by the Clean Seas company to breed tuna in captivity.
Kingfish and mulloway are already being bred at the site.

Shake-up for wool industry
The wool industry is set for a major shakeup, with the Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX) to abandon its auction rooms in Sydney and Melbourne and slash the size of its board.
AWEX will end its auction room leases at Yennora in Sydney and Brooklyn in Melbourne by the end of the year, handing the ball to wool brokers, who already run sales rooms in Newcastle and Fremantle.
A review of company services has found the wool industry holds market reporting and wool classer services above the provision of selling centres, although grower bodies and exporters have been surprised by the decision.
Chris Kelly from exporter Itochu says rival auctions by Australian Wool Handlers has put AWEX under pressure.
"Look I'm quite sure that if AWH didn't do what they did, I think this decision wouldn't have been made," he said.
"I think the exporters now would quite rightly question the benefit of AWEX in regard to saleroom issues."

Grim winter rain outlook for eastern Australia
Despite previous forecasts, eastern Australia now looks set to receive below average rainfall this winter.
The latest outlook from the National Climate Centre says most of Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland can expect a drier than average year, while Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory can expect close to average rains.
Climatologist Blair Trewin says regions still struggling with drought are the least likely to see big winter rains.
"The outlook for northern New South Wales and southern Queensland is a rather dry one," he said.
"In most of that region we are saying the chances of above average rainfall are only 35 to 40 per cent so about a 60 to 65 per cent chance of coming in below normal.

AWB to boost payments to growers
In some good news for the wheat industry, AWB Limited has increased the amount of money it will pay growers next year to reflect a big jump in world grain prices.
The National Pool Price is up $15 a tonne, at $220 for the benchmark Australian premium white wheat.
That is $32 higher than the current harvest price.
AWB's National Pools manager David Johnson says the move has been fuelled by a poorer crop outlook in the US, and higher investment in the futures market by hedge fund speculators.
"While futures have been rallying the cash market for wheat has not been reflecting that full rally in prices and this is one of the major reasons why we have a number of people saying the pools aren't going up as much as they could have and that is because the cash wheat market internationally has not gone up as much as the futures markets are reflecting," he said.
"Stocks continue to tighten, that certainly augurs well for prices as we move forward."

Cole inquiry
In related news, the head of the Australian Federal Police will meet with Oil for Food Commissioner Terence Cole next week, as he weighs up whether to investigate evidence from the inquiry.
AFP commissioner Mick Keelty has told a Senate estimates hearing there has been no decision on whether to press charges against AWB employees.
Under questioning he told the hearing evidence from the Cole inquiry is yet to be referred to the federal police.
"Not as yet Senator, I have a meeting with the royal commissioner on the first of June," he said.
"I don't suppose he's indicated what meeting's about?" asked the senator.
"Well I don't think that's an appropriate question to ask the commissioner in any event, even if he knew," Mr Keelty said.
Meanwhile the Federal Opposition has stepped up attacks on AWB for claiming a tax deduction on its $300 million kickback payments to Iraq.
Labor says AWB has legal advice claiming it will not suffer a tax penalty on the deduction, and has called on the Government to step-in.
But Assistant Treasurer Peter Dutton says the matter is in the hands of the Australian Tax Office, and it will decide if AWB should be penalised.

PM defends vote on Snowy Hydro sale
Prime Minister John Howard has rejected legal opinion that a vote on the sale of the Commonwealth's share in Snowy Hydro is unconstitutional.
He says the Government will press on with the sale, despite admitting most Australians are against it.
Opposition to the sale has built considerably since the Government and Labor agreed on a motion seven weeks ago, which cleared the way for the sell-off.
The Greens and some government members say they have legal advice the Parliament should have voted on legislation, and not just passed a parliamentary motion.
"The process of getting parliamentary approval for the sale of commonwealth Snowy Hydro shares is illegal," said Greens leader Bob Brown.
Mr Howard expects to hear more opposition from within his own party to the sale next week, but says his own legal advice is clear.

GG foreshadows future outback tours
After a fortnight sleeping in his swag, the Governor-General has called for all future governors-general to take annual tours of the outback.
Over the past two weeks, Major General Michael Jeffrey has covered thousands of kilometres from the Birdsville track to Western Australia's Tanami Desert, trying to bridge the divide between city and country.
Major General Jeffrey hopes an annual event could showcase the positives of rural life.
"And I'd hope to persuade my successors to do the same things, so it becomes part and parcel of the Governor-General's role to be out there in the bush, be seen to be in the bush and to be seen to be saying well done folks," he said.

Beef giant pays $97m for Top End stations
Australia's biggest beef producer will pay $97 million for two Northern Territory cattle stations.
The Australian Agricultural Company has entered into a heads of agreement sale with Heytesbury to buy "Anothony Lagoon" and "Eva Downs".

Vets call for regulation of animal welfare debate
The Australian Veterinary Association says governments must regulate how the animal welfare debate is presented to children.
It is critical of a campaign being run by animal rights group Voiceless, which encourages school children to speak out against issues like live exports and factory farming, saying its biased and threatens farming livelihoods.
President, Dr Matt Makin says children should be exposed to the debate, but is questioning what he says are extremist views from both sides.
"You know this is also a responsibility for governments who are in charge of school curriculums," he said.
"They need to, you know, be ensuring that children are exposed to all the facts on both sides of the debate so that the younger generation can form their own opinion.
"And presenting them with one side of the debate, I think, if this Government doesn't do anything about that I think it's quite irresponsible."

DNA used to identify stolen sheep
Police have used DNA testing to identify sheep at the centre of stock theft investigations in Victoria.
The Mildura Magistrates Court has found a farmer from Murrayville, in the state's north-west, guilty of theft, after DNA testing proved the genetic line of 40 cross-bred lambs.
Senior constable Andrew Harris says while the value of the sheep was at the lower end of the scale, the case demonstrates the value of the technology in investigations.

Riverland grape growers seek compo
The Riverland Wine Grape Growers Association wants a partial compensation package from the Federal Government.
It says the assistance drop uncontracted grapes on the ground, avoiding the need for them to sell fruit to wineries at low prices and contribute to the national oversupply.
Executive officer Chris Byrne says the money could come from the Wine Equalisation Tax.
"That would go a long way towards compensating growers not to sell their fruit at 100 or 200 dollars a tonne," he said.

Violence disrupts aid to E Timorese farmers
Australian aid efforts to help farmers in East Timor are being disrupted by violence which has erupted in the capital, Dili.
The Seeds of Life project introduces and tests new varieties of major food crops for subsistence farmers.
Team leader Rob Williams says roadblocks around Dili are making it hard to get out to surrounding districts.
"The work in the district continues on, we need to build planting material up, ready for next wet season," he said.
"Cassava, sweet potato, corn-seed and those plants are still growing on.
"We have staff in the districts who are continuing on with the work. The civil disturbance hasn't affected them, anywhere near as much as it has in Dili. There's drivers delivering sweet potato cuttings, we have staff irrigating maize crops, so that we have enough seed and planting material for next year.

Green award for horticulture industry
Efforts by the horticulture industry to stop using one of the worst chemicals to affect the ozone layer have been internationally recognised.
The tomato and strawberry industries have phased out the use of methyl bromide.
Australia agriculture has just been given an ozone protection award from the Environment Protection Authority in the US, which Jeff Mcspedden from Ausveg says recognises our clean and green industry.
"There's been some research done on alternatives and that was to use softer chemicals and the other one was to use steam generators to steam the soil, or to use solarisation where they plough it in the hotter climates and let the sun get rid of nematodes and problems in the soil," he said.

Merger could have dire consequences for Nationals: analyst
An expert on rural politics says the in-principle merger agreement between the Queensland Liberal and National parties is a disaster for the federal Nationals.
The agreement stems from months of talks between the Queensland conservatives parties on how best to beat Labor Premier Peter Beattie.
But political analyst Professor Brian Costar from Swinburne University says a merger even at a state level would have dire consequences for the Nationals in Queensland and federally.
He says a merger could cut the Nationals representation in the federal ministry and reduce the vote of both parities, leading to the rebirth of a 'One Nation style' party.
"Some of the issues that gave rise to One Nation, and particularly in Queensland where it was strongest, are still bubbling along below the surface," he said.
Federal party leader Mark Vaile has distanced the Nationals from a federal merger saying there has never been a better time for regional areas to have a specific rural conservative party.
In Queensland, the merger proposal has received a mixed response.
Just 18 months ago it was rejected out of hand, but today it is seen as the only way to ultimately topple Labor.
Lecturer in politics at Brisbane's Griffith University Paul Williams says farmers could be the ultimate losers.
"I think that they potentially have a lot to lose," he said.
"One can suspect that over time that the Nationals' voice will be drowned out.

Farmers' confidence at low levels
Nearly one third of farmers are expecting conditions to worsen in the coming year.
With a third successive survey in which confidence has declined, Rabobank head of rural banking, Neil Dobbin, says it is almost at the lowest level since surveys began.
Many farmers in New South Wales and Queensland are anxiously waiting for rain in order to start their winter cropping and livestock producers are also affected by the lack of feed and on-farm water supplies.
Mr Dobbin says the drought is causing great stress.
"We are really concerned for our clients and for the rural industry as a whole, there is nothing worse than being in this period of time when you are sitting on the fence if you like, waiting for rain," he said.
"We are in no man's land and we just pray that we really get some good rains and we need substantial rains.
"We just need that break, get the crops in, there is a lot of hand feeding going on at the moment.

More extreme weather predicted for Victoria
Victoria's Department of Primary Industries is predicting the state will experience more extreme weather, with increasing temperatures and less rainfall.
It is carrying out a research project called the Climate Change Challenge to try to help farmers adapt.
Project leader David Halliwell says most farmers in drier areas like the Wimmera and Mallee are used to a variable climate, but they might not be ready to cope with what climate models are predicting.
"Our frequency of extreme weather events are likely to increase into the future," he said.
"It is also saying that on average temperatures will increase but this doesn't just mean the maximum temperatures will increase, but the minimum temperatures will increase a little bit as well.

AQIS officers on alert in NT
Quarantine authorities in the Northern Territory are on full alert, as evacuees from East Timor continue to arrive.
More than 700 of the estimated 25,000 people displaced from Dili have flown into Darwin.
C-130 Hercules cargo planes are carrying up to 180 evacuees at a time from Dili to Darwin on unscheduled flights.
So far, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has checked over 720 evacuees from East Timor and 209 crew from the Defence Force.
Whilst many of the passengers are traumatised and are carrying the bare minimum in the haste to escape the unrest, all bags are being X-rayed or searched for exotic plants like siam and khaki weed, and diseases such as grapevine leaf rust.
The giant African snail is also a major risk, and clothing, and footwear is being searched for its eggs, which can be carried in soil material.

Wine export prices drop
The latest wine industry survey has found wine export prices are down by a third since 2002 and 40 per cent of Australian wineries are running at a loss.
The Deloitte Wine Industry Benchmarking Survey indicates many wineries are struggling to survive, particularly in export markets.
Deliotte partner Stephen Harvey says the big supermarket chains in Europe have taken advantage of the Australian wine glut and are forcing prices down, and the whole industry is feeling the pain.
"We are seeing a lot of it go over for buyers' own brands in the big supermarket chains, your Sainburys, Tescos, Aldis etc," he said.
"That of course does have a flow-on effect to the branded wines. If people are able to buy buyers' own brands at very cheap prices, it naturally adds some pricing pressure to your more popular and well-known brands."
Meanwhile, grape growers in South Australia's Riverland have welcomed the proposal for a partial compensation package.
About 600 people attended a rally yesterday, hearing proposals from the local grower association, which will be put to Friday's wine industry summit in Melbourne.
The package recommends growers with uncontracted grapes be paid $5,000 per hectare to not harvest them in the hope of reducing the national oversupply.
The $80 million cost would be shared by governments and industry.
Loxton grower Glen Arnold says he hopes the proposal is considered.
"It's a way forward for growers to have some hope," he said.

Canola price on the way up
The price outlook for canola has improved over the last few weeks, with Canadian carry over stocks and projected plantings being reduced.
As well, Canada has reported improved crush tonnages and canola exports.
Katie Cole, from Cooperative Bulk Handling in Albany in Western Australia, says there is also good news on canola pricing from Europe's bio-fuel industry.
"Europe is also the last major reason why we're seeing some really good news in the canola market and that's the bio-diesel industry," she said.
"Europe's expected to double it's consumption of vegie oils for bio-diesel this year which will mean going up from 3 million tonnes to 6 million tonnes.

Station sale to allow for expansion
The head of Heytesbury says the sale of two of its cattle stations will allow for more strategic investment into its existing live export cattle and wine businesses.
Heytesbury announced the $97 million sale of Anthony Lagoon and Eva Downs Stations in the Northern Territory to Australia's biggest beef producer, Australian Agricultural Company, on Friday.
Chairman Janet Holmes a Court says while there are no immediate plans to purchase other stations, the company might look to consolidate some of its operations.
"It gives us the opportunity also to maybe expand our wine operations or buy other properties that are closer to the VRDs and the Kimberley properties that we already have," she said.

Raspberry levy to go into marketing
Raspberry growers across Australia will have to pay a new industry levy from July 1 to cover costs of more research and development.
The $13 million industry is set to be boosted by the 10 cents a kilo levy, which will be collected by wholesale agents and supermarkets, and imposed on exported berries.

Tomato growers aim for sweet success
Growing sweeter tomatoes has been identified as the major goal for Australian growers over the next five years.
Processing tomato growers, whose crops are made into paste and sauce, are currently drawing up their Industry strategic plan.
Over the last 30 years, the amount of tomatoes produced per hectare has risen from 25 to 84 tonnes.
But the chair of the Australian Processing Tomato Research Council, Ian Bryce, says their taste suffered.
"The sweetness of tomatoes has gone down," he said.

NFF concerned about Snowy Hydro privatisation
Opposition to the privatisation of Snowy Hydro continues to build.
The nation's chief rural lobby group has, for the first time, expressed serious concerns about the sale and its effect on the National Water Initiative.
The National Farmers Federation (NFF) fears little regard will be given to farmers who rely on Snowy Hydro's water if the scheme is sold-off.
And NFF president Peter Corish says funds from any privatisation should be used to protect the environment, irrigators and affected river communities.
He has also called for tighter regulation of Snowy investors, including a permanent 10 per cent cap on ownership of Snowy shares.
"We want to ensure private ownership of the water behind a dam wall, which is something that is certainly new, it's a new principle for us in Australia that doesn't negatively impact on the people who benefit from that water currently," he said.
The three federal independents will table a motion in Parliament today, calling for the sale to be blocked entirely.
And Nationals MP Kay Hull plans to introduce a private member's bill into Federal Parliament to permanently cap individual shareholdings in Snowy Hydro to 10 per cent.
The legislation would also stipulate that the majority of directors be Australian and that the head office remains in this country.
Mrs Hull opposes the sale, but says, as a last resort, this bill would limit foreign ownership.
"I will continue to fight the sale, this is a safety net in the event the sale can not be ceased," she said.
"I want to ensure that enshrined in legislation is all of the safeguards that need to take place to ensure that big companies and overseas companies can't come in and buy up the Snowy."
It is unclear whether the private member's bill will receive the support of the Government or the Opposition.

Snowy River clearance work 'too little, too late'
A group of farmers in Victoria's Gippsland region says blockages at the mouth of the Snowy River are being overlooked.
Reduced flows and drought have caused a sandbar to form across the mouth of the Snowy at Marlo, flooding local pastures and crops.
Clearance work began yesterday but residents say it is too little, too late.
Parks Victoria ranger Dennis Matthews says opening the mouth of the Snowy is difficult and he sympathises with farmers whose properties have been flooded.
"It's not easy being a farmer enduring drought and so on, and then having something like this happen," he said.
"I can understand fully their plight A lot of people farm in low lying areas so I can understand that they would like to see conditions of opening changed.
Queensland Nationals leader Lawrence Springborg is pushing ahead with his plans to merge his party with the Liberals despite significant opposition from both federal Coalition party leaders.
The Prime Minister says he will only support the Nationals becoming Liberals, while federal Nationals leader Mark Vaile is worried his party will be destabilised by the discussions.
This morning in Canberra, National and Liberal politicians were locked in a joint party room meeting discussing the proposal but Mr Springborg says he does not need their approval.
"Queensland could still go it alone and there's a whole range of ways that you can do this to accommodate the concerns that have been raised because those matters have not had the chance to be able to be put," he said.

Beef industry helps out in quake recovery effort
The Australian beef industry is helping with the recovery in quake-hit Yogyakarta in Java.
Feedlotters, including the Consolidated Pastoral Company's Indonesian Joint Venture, are among those helping fund aid for 100,000 homeless people.
Nurendro Trikesowo of the Indonesian Cattle and Buffalo Farmers Association says he is installing 20 health clinics and 20 simple water filters this week.
"That is just a pocket filter system, using some ceramic filters, to make the purification of the water, filtering the water from [toxic bacteria such as] E. coli," he said.
"That is an important thing, that the water will be hygienic to drink for the people. [But] we are just a small part because they need a lot of funds for the recovery and reconstruction.

Goat meat processor seeks more overseas workers
The meat processing industry is negotiating with the Immigration Department about the use of overseas workers.
The nation's largest goat meat processor, Neil Duncan of Charleville in Queensland, says he needs more overseas workers if he is to stay in operation.
But Mr Duncan says the department has stopped processing applications for skilled workers under the 457 visa program.
"The Immigration Department needs to recognise that the meat industry does need skilled workers," he said.
"We can source skilled workers from overseas. They are there waiting and unless they actually start processing our applications, the meat industry in Australia is going backwards.
"We've got to the stage now where we're turning away livestock. We can't process livestock because we just don't have the people to be able to do it."

Grain boosts ABB profits
South Australian agriculture company ABB grain has announced a 24 per cent rise in after tax, half-year profit.
The result for the two-year old corporation is largely attributed to a 35 per cent increase in grain receivals for the last season.
Grain market analyst, Malcolm Bartholemaeus, says that despite the malting section of the company struggling, it is still a strong result.

Wheat consortium expected to announce Iraq deal
An Australian consortium negotiating a 350,000 tonne wheat contract with Iraq is expected to announce this afternoon it has sealed a deal worth close to $100 million.
Last Monday, Wheat Australia said it had failed to come to suitable terms with Iraq and negotiations for the $90 million dollar deal were over.

Strawberry prices tipped to fall
Strawberry prices could fall dramatically later this year.
Queensland's strawberry season is under way, with growers enjoying the best prices they have seen in over a decade - up to $8 a punnet in some supermarkets.
But Bill Sharpe, from the Queensland Strawberry Growers Association, says there will be an oversupply and rock-bottom prices by September.
"Somewhere along the line the middle man get certainly the benefit of it with this oversupply, but the blame is sort of twofold anyway," he said.

WA bans biodiesel plants
Western Australia's Agriculture Protection Board has placed a state-wide ban on two plants being heavily promoted on the Internet as sources of biodiesel.
Bellyache bush and physic nut are both invasive plants, highly toxic to humans and livestock.
Both plants are already on the WA declared plants list, but their status has been upgraded to make sure they are banned state-wide.

Hundreds of stock horses to gather for Polocrosse World Cup
Up to 200 Australian stock horses will be drafted for next year's Polocrosse World Cup in Queensland.
The event will see eight international teams play over a 10-day period in April, at Warwick on the Darling Downs.
World Cup chief horse coordinator, Kent Wells, said it is the nation's biggest recruitment of horses in peacetime.
"Every state will have some," he said.

Young Aussies urged to see outback
From the tracks of Birdsville to the Tanami Desert, the administrator of the Northern Territory has called for an outback visit to become a rite of passage for young Australians, similar to the Gallipoli pilgrimages on Anzac Day.
Ted Egan has proposed a heritage tour, which would particularly encourage city kids to head to the bush.
He says it would help show important elements of this country's history,

Extension granted for forestry tax change submissions
An extension of time has been granted for submissions on the changes to plantation forestry taxes.
Some of the changes include putting a cap on expenditure on plantations in the first year and tax write-offs being conditional on best practice being used.
The closing date for submissions has been extended for another month, until mid-July.
Assistant Treasurer Peter Dutton says it is in response to requests for more time from a number of affected farmers and foresters.
But he denies there has been a backlash to the proposed changes.
"Right around the country in rural areas some farmers are strongly in favour of the way in which these forestry plantations are operated," he said.
"Other farmers outside of the industry have concerns that there is the potential for high prices, inflated prices to be paid for land.

Mixed predictions for pulp mill
Shareholders of Tasmanian forestry giant, Gunns Limited, have been advised that the company's plans to build a pulp mill are risky and they should sell their shares.
The Commonwealth Bank's shares and stockbroking arm, CommSec, predicts Gunns' planned $1.4 billion pulp mill will never be cost-effective.
But industry analyst, Robert Eastment, says he has checked the facts in the report, and does not believe the negativity is warranted.
"It's just another report. There are some good ones, there are some bad ones," he said.

Grain consortium hopeful of more deals with Iraq
Australian grain consortium Wheat Australia says it does not envisage any shipping problems when it begins the export of 350,000 tonnes of wheat to Iraq in the next month.
Twelve weeks of negotiations concluded yesterday when Wheat Australia announced the $100 million wheat contract with Iraq had been finalised.
Spokesman Rhys Ainsworth says with one agreement reached, Wheat Australia is keen to explore further market opportunities.
"I think the good thing about the position that Wheat Australia has got to now is that we have agreed on commercially workable terms that we believe can provide Wheat Australia with a solid platform that will enable it to continue what has been a very long association with one of Australia's most critical international markets," he said.
Plum Grove commodity trader Tony Smith says the deal is good news for Australian growers but prices are still below what farmers in the United States would receive.
He estimates the deal to be worth around $190 a tonne, about $30 below expectations, but does not believe AWB could have done much better.
"At the end of the day, this deal would not have gone ahead if the AWB wasn't happy with the price," he said.
"So there's no way the AWB could've got more. You know, Wheat Australia did everything they could. There's definitely people who are going to come out and make those comments and they're just political comments, scaremongering.

Planned merger not achievable, Vaile says
Federal Nationals leader Mark Vaile says a proposal to merge the Queensland National and Liberal Parties now won't go ahead.
He met with Queensland Nationals leader Lawrence Springborg yesterday and while he denies he has convinced Mr Springborg to abort the plan, Mr Vaile thinks the merger is not achievable.
He says effort now needs to go into developing the Queensland Coalition.
"Clearly if you look at the public comment and concern that's been raised we are fast reaching a point where that is not going to be achievable," he said.
"So my view we need to ensure that Queensland moves ahead developing and refining the existing Coalition arrangements in Queensland."
Deputy federal leader of the Nationals Warren Truss says there is strong support for a united conservative force in Queensland but the merger model was unfair and unworkable for members of the National party .

Snowy Hydro foreign ownership cap not enough: rice growers
The Ricegrowers Association of Australia says the cap on foreign ownership of Snowy Hydro is not enough to protect irrigators' interests.
The New South Wales, Victorian and Federal Governments yesterday agreed to permanently limit foreign ownership of the scheme to 35 per cent, with a cap of 15 per cent for individual foreign investors.
But Ricegrowers Association president Laurie Arthur says that would not prevent a large Australian company buying a majority stake.
"It's some recognition that the governments are listening to the concern that have been put to them," he said.
"It doesn't go far enough, we still believe there's the capacity for an Australian company to have undue influence as regards to the licence that control the water and the release of water."
The Murray Darling Basin Commission and the National Farmers Federation are also worried about aspects of the deal.
But federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says regardless of who owns Snowy Hydro, the interests of irrigators are guaranteed in the Snowy water licensing agreement.
"It was developed by the Australian, New South Wales and Victorian Governments at the time of corporatisation specifically to protect security, it guarantees the volumes for irrigators," he said.

McGuigan Simeon writes down wine stocks
Wine company McGuigan Simeon will write down wine stocks by up to $20 million and will not pay a final dividend to its shareholders this year.
On Monday the company asked the Australian Stock Exchange to halt its trading until this morning, when the results of an operational review were released.
Managing director Dane Hudson says the company was forced to write down stocks because of the recent decline in bulk wine prices.
"It's a small percentage of our total stock," he said.
"This is probably a 9 per cent reduction and it's for older vintages. We are comfortable with our 2006 vintage but this is older stock that we need to reprice to clear on the bulk market."

Survey points to excellent outlook for dairy farmers
There is an excellent outlook for Australia's dairy industry.
Dairy Australia has released its latest report based on the annual dairy farmer survey and interviews with industry members.
The report finds nearly two thirds of dairy farmers are looking to increase the scale of their operations but many smaller operators are selling out or changing to beef or crops.
Increased demand means strong price competition for suppliers between processors.
But one of the report's authors, Steve Spencer, says processors are concerned that tight supply will mean a loss of markets.

Naracoorte meatworkers angry over wages
Local workers at a South Australian abattoir are angry that their hours have been cut, while Chinese employees on temporary visas are being paid full-time wages.
Two hundred and sixty Australian workers at the Teys Brothers meatworks at Naracoorte have been working a four-day week because of a shortage of stock.
But even though the Chinese workers are working a similar number of hours, their visa conditions require that they receive a full week's pay.
Graham Smith, from the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union, says it is absurd.
"The meat industry is seasonal to start with," he said.
"Where the terms of the visa are that you've got to have a severe skills shortage that you've got to fill, it seems absurd that in an industry where we stand people down for large parts of the year because there's no work for them, that you can say there's a corresponding skills shortage."

Farmers give Vic Budget thumbs down
The Victorian Farmers Federation says the Victorian Budget has failed to target pressing road, rail and water infrastructure needs in rural areas.
In fact, the farming body says the State Budget is so disappointing that it may campaign against the Bracks Government during the November election.
VFF president Simon Ramsay says while funding for education is welcome, the Budget is one of missed opportunities.
"The roads is the main one," he said.

Lettuce aphids found in SA
The currant lettuce aphid has been found in South Australia for the first time.
Authorities have detected the pest on properties in the Adelaide Hills and the northern Adelaide Plains.
The aphid was found in Victoria last year and has plagued lettuce crops in Tasmania since 2004.
Originally, South Australia banned imports of interstate lettuce to protect the industry, but this has now been removed.

Tas apple industry facing challenges
The future of apple growing in the Apple Isle is being re-examined, in the light of increased global competition, a high dollar and increasing production costs.
Fruit Growers Tasmania has held a growers meeting to discuss the challenges.
One of the more well-known orcharding families, the Drieesen brothers at Castle Forbes Bay, is opting out of the industry after 50 years.
Jos Driessen says the land, overlooking the scenic D'Entrecasteaux Channel, will be sold to sea changers.
"My plans for the future are to retire. I've been losing the passion to grow apples. I think it's becoming a more difficult industry to be in," he said.

Flinders Is may go native under tourism plan
One of South Australia's biggest islands could become an ecotourism venture.
Peter and Pam Woolford have begun discussions with the Department of Environment and Heritage about de-stocking Flinders Island, which is off Elliston on the state's west coast.
Mr Woolford says he wants to control the feral animals and reintroduce native plants and animals.
"What I'd like to see is the native flora and fauna returned more to its natural state," he said.
"We have some feral animals there, which are probably an inheritance off the Kupara, which ran aground on the island in 1946.

Labour shortage hits northern NSW
More than 50 agricultural jobs are currently going begging on the New South Wales north coast despite unemployment there being almost double the national average.
The beef, chicken and pork industries are facing a critical shortage of labour.
Northern Co-operative Meat Company's Gary Burridge says local businesses are finding workers are turning away from the rural sector.
"We in our organisation are suffering a severe shortage of highly skilled labour and semi-skilled labour," he said.

Govt blueprint for the bush revealed
The Beattie Government has unveiled a long-awaited $150 million blueprint for rural and regional Queensland.
The blueprint is a three-way partnership between state and local governments and the lobby group Agforce.
It came out of anger over tree-clearing laws and a feeling of neglect by the regions west of the Great Dividing Range.
It aims to improve the sustainability, liveability and profitability of regional Queensland.
It covers a new agreement allowing for up to 50 year leases and a commitment to reviewing how tree clearing laws are implemented.
It is also going to pay farmers to be stewards of the environment.

Govt expected to abandon diesel fuel rebate changes
The Federal Government is expected to announce a backflip on proposed changes to its diesel fuel rebate later today.
Under the current system, fuel energy credits are refunded to farmers and other big diesel users through cash payments to bank accounts.
The Government had planned to add the refund to GST rebates, which industry said would create a cash-flow nightmare.

Labor targets regional Coalition voters
The Federal Opposition has moved to capitalise on the turmoil within the Nationals, launching a drive to win over disaffected Coalition voters in regional Australia.
Labor leader Kim Beazley met with the National Farmers Federation (NFF) last night.
He says he wants to open a new dialogue directly with regional Australia.
Mr Beazley says Labor and farmers have plenty in common, despite Labor's opposition to the Workchoices policy and importing foreign workers, which are both supported by the NFF.
Mr Beazley says the party will win seats in regional Australia at the next election based on what he says is a cumulative affect of issues like the sell-off of Telstra, Australia's trade performance and the now defunct Nationals merger.
"After a while everyone wakes up and this is what's happening now," he said.
Mr Beazley says regional development spokesman Simon Crean and disendorsed Opposition agriculture spokesman Gavan O'Connor will lead the regional policy push.

Beef exporters brace for US competition
The United States is hoping to cut Australia's $500 million beef market to South Korea when exports resume next week.
Meat and Livestock Australia's regional manager in Korea Glenn Feist says exporters are bracing themselves for major competition for the first time in more than two years.
He expects to see export levels drop but hopes Australia will be able to hold onto a market share of around 50 per cent.
"Australia won brand of the year twice in a row here with the country of origin labelling with our statement: 'Australian beef clean and safe'," he said.
"But since the US has been out it has given us an opportunity and we grow beef for the five star dining hotels and that sort of stuff - we have got manufacturing beef for the McDonald's and the Burger King [chains] and those guys.
"So I think we will hold our own pretty well up here."
The Cattle Council says Australian producers are likely to retain their stronghold on the market for bone-in beef in Korea.
The amount of US beef allowed in will be limited by a continuing ban on cattle over 30 months of age, which will help Australia remain competitive, according to council president Bill Bray.
"The main trade in beef into Korea has been the bone-in short rib and we've been asked to continue to supply that because we have the highest freedom-ranking for BSE in the world," he said.

Irrigation charge increase expected to hurt farmers
Many New South Wales irrigators look set to pay more for the delivery of their water.
The Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal has released a draft report proposing significant increases to bulk water charges.
The impact will vary across the State but Murray Irrigation is expecting charges to rise by 80 per cent over four years.
General manager George Warne says that is going to hurt farmers.
"Governments don't realise that we've been beaten up by four or five years of drought," he said.

Wool broker plays down buyer protest
Tasmanian wool broker, Roberts Limited, is playing down a protest by buyers at an auction in Melbourne this week.
Sources claim a large number of buyers did not bid on the Roberts catalogue because they believe the company's new wool pool, to supply fibre direct to customers, will cost them their commission.
Of 2,500 bales offered by Roberts, 38 per cent were passed in.
Murray Best from Roberts has confirmed the protest but says it only involved four buyers.
He says the company only wants to sell 10 per cent of Tasmanian wool through the pool system but admits that figure could increase.

Simplot increases prices for pea growers
Vegetable processor Simplot says it is responding to the concerns raised through the Fair Dinkum Food Campaign by offering Tasmanian farmers better prices and contracts for their peas.
Simplot wants to almost double the amount of peas it buys to meet new demand from the major supermarket chains for Australian-grown product.
Managing director Terry O'Brien is also hoping a 6 per cent price rise will encourage growers back into the industry.
"I'm encouraging them to think about the fact that they stimulated a lot of interest last year with their tractor trip to Canberra," he said.

Cattle feedlot given green light
The New South Wales Government has approved a $60 million cattle feedlot at Moira Station near Mathoura in the southern Riverina.
The 160,000 head feedlot will be one of Australia's biggest and include a feed mill and hay processor.
The State Government has ordered the developers to start the feedlot operating at half capacity, with an independent audit required before production can be increased.

Export markets go feral over turn-off label for goat meat
The goat industry is being urged to ditch the term "feral" and relabel its meat to Australian "rangeland" goat.
While there has been a big jump in the number of farmed meat goats in Australia, at least half of the country's exports still come from the feral goat population in semi-arid rangeland country.
John Hayes, from the Wodonga abattoir, which exports to the US, says the term feral is a big turn-off for overseas buyers.

NQ school to set up vet training centre
A north Queensland boarding school is tackling a shortage of rural vets head on.
The Columbia Catholic College plans to build a veterinary training centre on its campus in Charters Towers.
College principal Althea Norton hopes investing more than $300,000 in a new centre will encourage more students to take up vet science.

Teens urged to consider joining cattle industry
More teenagers are being encouraged to consider joining the cattle industry as part of a partnership between a public high school and a cattle station.
The Northern Territory's Coodardie Brahman Stud supplies weaner steers to Taminmin High School on Darwin's outskirts.
The bush steers are broken to halter and presented for show and sale by the students.
Stud director Moira O'brien says it helps to give them a better understanding about the production and marketing cycle of the cattle industry.
"We really enjoy helping them out and working in their program, and I think it's really important for that industry community, collaboration, and anywhere where we can encourage young people and teach city people about agricultural life and cattle station workings and the industry, I think is really, really important," she said.

Irrigators pass no confidence vote in NSW Govt
A vote of no confidence has been passed in the New South Wales Government over its handling of the sale of Snowy Hydro.
The move by Riverina irrigators comes as Finance Minister John Della Bosca meets with concerned farmers today at Deniliquin in the state's south.
Last night in Deniliquin, 300 people showed their displeasure at the New South Wales Government's handling of the sale of Snowy Hydro.
Mr Della Bosca was invited to the public meeting, organised by the Nationals but declined.
Today, in the same town, he will talk with irrigators in a closed meeting to hear their concerns about the sale of Snowy Hydro.
Organised by the Southern Riverina Irrigators Group, farmers say they are worried about what will happen to water entitlements if the Snowy scheme is privatised.

Irrigators relieved at Snowy Hydro sale collapse
Irrigators say they are surprised and relieved at the collapse of the sale of the Snowy Hydro electricity scheme.
The Federal Government pulled out of the sale this morning, citing concern from backbenchers and growing public opposition.
The New South Wales and Victorian Governments have also backed down.
Laurie Arthur from the Rice Growers Association says he did not think there was any way to stop the sale.
He says irrigators were worried about their access to water once the scheme was privatised and most will be pleased with the about-turn.
"I'm sure probably 80 per cent of irrigators are delighted that Snowy Hydro will not be privatised," he said.
"I think some of our people think that governments don't do a particularly good job of running companies and so it's still a very complicated issue and I would predict that we haven't actually seen the last of it within the next 10 years would be surprised if it doesn't raise its head again."
Prime Minister John Howard says although irrigator licensing conditions were a factor in the Government's decision, it was public opinion that forced the change.

Govt urged to protect local ethanol industry
The ethanol industry says it will be devastated by a Federal Government proposal to allow cheap imports into Australia.
Legislation table in Parliament calls for the excise on imported ethanol to be reduced by 2011 to the same rate as locally-produced biofuel.
It also outlines a planned increase in taxes for Australian-made ethanol from 2.5 cents a litre to 12.5 cents.
Bob Gordon from Renewable Fuels Australia says the Government should do more to protect the local industry.
"Unlike other countries we are going to be one of the first countries in the world to actually tax renewable fuels," he said.
"Now we're prepared to live with that but we want a regime for transition that stimulates new industry growth rather than undermining it.
"The one proposed in the tax Bill will clearly undermine that goal."
Resources Minister Ian Macfarlane has denied the claims.
He says ethanol will still have an excise advantage over petrol and the industry has had years to prepare for the changes.
Meanwhile the Federal Government has decided to phase in its changes to the diesel fuel rebate, to give farmers and transport operators time to adjust.
The plan will replace cash payments to farmers with a refund added to GST rebates and was due to be implemented on July 1.
But now, during a two-year transition period, farmers will be able to claim their rebate, but will also have to report it in business activity statements.
South Australian farmer Doug Hall says that will make the system more complicated.
"I just don't see it being any easier at all, it just doesn't make sense to me so why are they playing around with this you know, who is the winner at the end of the day?" he said.
"I'm certainly not sure it's the farmer, it's the damn Government again."
The renewable energy industry wants a national incentive-based market to encourage consumers to use cleaner fuel.
It has released a report looking at development to 2050, in which renewable energy will be cheaper, have high export potential and provides a clean and cheap solution to climate change and energy shortages.
David Holland from Renewable Energy Generators Australia says the Federal Government should extend tax breaks to get the technology up and running.
"The technologies will always be more expensive than the old process of pulling coal out of the ground and setting fire to it," he said.
"The environment is a critical issue not just for Australia but for the planet and really the governments are the only people that are in the position to take that leadership but there needs to be some systemic processes that drive the move towards renewables."
The Government has rejected the call, saying hundreds of millions of dollars have already been allocated to renewable energy generation.

Code of practice limits use of sow stalls
The pork industry has agreed to limit the use of sow stalls under a new code of practice for the welfare of pigs.
Australian Pork Limited, the peak body representing producers, says it will reduce the amount of time pigs spend in the stalls, from the full 16 weeks of pregnancy to six weeks.
Peter Robertson from the New South Wales Farmers Association says it is a proactive step to improve animal care.
"The industry has taken the decision that we have to concede that we need to have sows with a little more exercise during gestation," he said.
"By the same token we need the sow stalls for the first six weeks that they are pregnant so that they do not abort and have other problems at that stage."

Hunter Valley coal miners remain on strike
One hundred Hunter Valley coal miners are into the second day of a week-long strike after a breakdown in talks over wages and conditions.
Workers at the Xstrata-owned United Colliery are the first to undertake a court-approved stoppage under the new federal industrial relations reforms.
They have been attempting to settle on a new enterprise agreement since December.
Xstrata says it has made a good offer and believes the strike is part of a broad political campaign by the unions.
But Grahame Kelly from the CFMEU says the offer does not reflect the performance of the work force.

Boral Timber mills to close
Boral Timber is closing two mills on the north coast of New South Wales as part of a major restructure.
The Kempsey and Bostobrick Mill near Dorrigo will close, with the loss of 47 jobs.

Grain growers told to stop sowing crops
Western Australian grain growers are being told to stop sowing crops because there is no rain in sight for at least two weeks.
Many farmers have already planted a good percentage of their crops and state authorities say they need to assess their financial position.
Peter Metcalf from the Department of Agriculture in Geraldton says it is time to pull up the seeders and start making a plan for the rest of this season.
"What tends to happen in this situation, which is a very unusual situation, most growers haven't previously been in this state, or these conditions previously, is that you start the program and you continue on," he said.

Violence hits E Timorese agriculture
East Timor's agriculture sector has been seriously affected by recent violence.
Fires, looting and mayhem in the capital Dili have destroyed eight years of research and documentation.
The price of fresh fruit and vegetables has also sky-rocketed.
Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Estanislau Da Silva, also fears coffee exports could be down by more than half.
"Now we are in the coffee season. It's the harvesting coffee season and this can have a tremendous impact on the livelihood and the people who depend on coffee," he said.

Ugly sheep could save wool industry
The search is on for the ugliest merino lambs, because they could save Australia's billion dollar wool industry.
Scientists from the South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI) and the University of Adelaide are looking for sheep with 'unusual wool', saying they hold the key to improving the genetic quality of merino wool.
Professor Phil Hynd from the University of Adelaide says lambs are usually culled because they have uneven wool, no crimp or bare patches.
He says studying the lambs will help them identify genes which affect wool production.
"We've already got about half a dozen animals that producers provided us with and man, they're the weirdest looking mob of sheep that you've ever seen in your life," he said.
"They're quite embarrassing really, even the sheep look embarrassed.

Indonesian fishermen to face court over alleged poaching
Twelve Indonesian fishermen will face court in Broome today, accused of poaching the sea cucumber delicacy, trepang.

Wine grower suggests pulling out cool climate vines
A respected South Australian vigneron has suggested pulling out grape vines in cool climate vineyards and putting the land to other use.
Coonawarra vigneron Ian Hollick says grape growers in cooler areas have been selling fruit at below the cost of production for the past three years, and there is no end in sight.
He does not think a proposal to compensate struggling grape growers is the way forward for the industry.
"I think its getting to the stage where we have to really bite the bullet and say that we need to remove so many thousands of hectares of cool climate grapes," he said.

Farmers still want access to Snowy Hydro documents
Farmers still want access to confidential information about water releases from Snowy Hydro, despite the collapse of plans to sell the electricity scheme.
Last week the New South Wales Government promised to let a delegation of farmers see documents relating to when water is released for irrigation.
Within 24 hours the Federal Government had withdrawn from the sale and it was abandoned.
Chairman of Southern Riverina Irrigators Ted Hatty says farmers will hold the State Government to its promise.

Doctors urge govt reform on rural medical services
Doctors say access to obstetric services in rural Australia is becoming critical and are calling for urgent government reform.
In allegations to be aired on ABC's Four Corners program tonight, doctors also claim that in some areas chemotherapy is being administered by people without formal qualifications.
They have also raised concerns about the loneliness of cancer patients forced to move to the city for treatment and the pressures that are forcing doctors to pack up and leave country towns.
Dr Ross Maxwell from the Rural Doctors Association says the problems are acute and most efforts to solve them are not making much difference.
"We have been reluctant to try and look at the economics around rural and remote practice and say well if the mining industry want to get professionals out into a remote community they make sure the conditions are right and attractive and can get them out there," he said.

Group seeks Govt help to reduce regional alcohol abuse
A national alcohol rehabilitation group is calling on the Federal Government to help stem the rise of alcohol abuse in regional Australia.
The Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation wants the Government to fund ongoing campaigns in rural areas because the level of injury and death from alcohol are much higher than in the cities.
Foundation chief executive Daryl Smeaton says it does not make sense that $2 billion has been spent on campaigns against illicit drugs, when only 5 per cent of the population use them.
He says for 85 per cent of people, alcohol is their drug of choice.
"We think of a drug problem, we think of cannabis and amphetamines because that's what the Federal Government keeps on telling us," he said.

Tas cow tests positive for hydatid tapeworm
A Tasmanian bred cow has tested positive for the hydatid tapeworm, the state's first case in a decade.
Tasmania embarked on a world leading hydatid eradication program 40 years ago and while hydatids have been discovered since, most have been traced to imported stock.
The state was declared provisionally-free of hydatid disease in 1996.
Chief vet Rod Andrewartha says the infected cow was part of a mixed line of cattle.
"Occasionally of course we will detect cysts and we can normally trace them back to sheep or cattle imported from the mainland, in this particular case we found it in an animal which was born and bred in Tasmania," he said.

Herpes-like virus threatens Vic abalone stocks
Efforts are under way to control a herpes-like virus which is killing abalone off the south-west Victorian coast.
The disease, ganglioneuritis, has been detected at four farms in south-west Victoria and at Flinders near Port Phillip Bay, with millions of dollars worth of stock having to be destroyed.
Fisheries Victoria says the disease has now escaped into the wild off Port Fairy.
Fisheries executive director Peter Appleford says although a similar disease devastated the abalone industry in Taiwan in 2003, he is hopeful control measures will stop a further spread here.
"What we're looking at is to put some controls in place along the coastline to limit the activity there," he said.

Dept, fishermen warn of imported prawn disease
Queensland's Department of Primary Industries has issued a warning against using imported raw prawns as bait, amid growing concerns they could carry disease.
Commercial fishermen want raw prawn imports stopped, claiming health inspections are too random.
They say up to 60 consignments have recently tested positive for white spot disease, the so-called foot and mouth of prawns.
Dr Ian Anderson, Queensland's principal veterinary pathologist on fish disease, agrees that imports do pose a threat.
"Prawns imported for human consumption can get purchased by recreational fishers and then used in their fishing activities and so that is a potential route of the spread of the virus from the imported product for human consumption through to our wild fishery stock," Dr Anderson said.

Lobster fishermen deny flooding market with snapper
South Australian lobster fishermen have rejected claims they are flooding the market with snapper and forcing down prices.
The SA Rock Lobster Advisory Council says fishermen are entitled to fish for snapper in the lobster off-season but have only caught 10 tonnes of the fish since July last year.
Spokesman Daryl Spencer has denied claims that two lobster boats unloaded 10 tonnes of snapper each at Port Lincoln at the weekend.
"There's one boat at this point in time since the end of our lobster season that's actually targeted snapper and in the 10 days that he has been fishing, he's taken in total 3.9 tonnes in total," he said.

Indonesian fishermen jailed for poaching sea cucumbers
Eleven Indonesian fishermen have been jailed after being caught poaching the sea cucumber, trepang, in Australian waters north of Broome in Western Australia last month.
They were on board two boats intercepted by the Navy at Scott Reef.
One of the captains has been sentenced to seven months jail, while the other captain and nine crew members have been fined.
They will spend between three and six months in jail because they could not pay the penalties.

March floods continue to impact on Ord River crop yields
Horticulturalists in the far north of Western Australia are still feeling the effects of floods which hit the Ord River region earlier this year.
In March, 300 millimetres of rain fell within 24 hours, making sown crops look like rice paddies.
Farmer David Menzell says he should now be in top-gear harvesting melons but has lost a whole month of production,

Historic SA outback hotels set for sale
An increasing number of hotels are up for sale in outback South Australia.
Among them are the Oodnadatta Roadhouse and the iconic Mungerannie Hotel on the Birdsville Track.
Publican Genevieve Hammond says after 11 years they have decided to move from the desert and head north to the tropics of north Queensland.
She says although fewer people want to move to remote areas, they have already got some interested buyers.

Students showcase environmentally sound projects
School students from New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT are in Canberra for a Youth River Health Conference.
The students have been working on environmental projects in the classroom and will give presentations in the form of music, dance, skits and board games.
Projects range from wildlife habitats to compost systems in playgrounds.

CSIRO report urges rural, urban water trading
A major scientific report says city water authorities should be allowed to buy water from farmers to sustain the growing urban population.
The CSIRO says without reform, water costs in metropolitan areas could rise more than 10 times over the next 25 years.
The report from the CSIRO and Monash University predicts Perth, Brisbane and Sydney will be the worst affected cities with the price of water jumping up to 10 times unless better reforms are put in place.
Three models have been tested and CSIRO says the most successful would be a combination of urban and rural water trading, alongside more efficient water use including desalination plants.
And while farmers could make a lot of money from water trading, the system would change the face of agriculture in Australia.
The CSIRO's Mike Young says urban/rural water trading is already working in South Australia and WA farmers are leading the way in saving water.
"Agriculture's a lot more skilful in improving water use efficiency and in 25 years time they've made a 50 per cent greater advance than urban Australia, so there's a challenge for urban Australia to catch up and show they're actually as smart as our farmers are," Mr Young said.
Bit some irrigators are worried about the social impact of water being diverted into the capital cities.
Although he believes some form of water trading with the cities is inevitable, Victorian dairy farmer Max Fehring says governments need to make sure urban residents share the cost of water infrastructure with rural communities.

Aust wheat price surges on back of international season
There is finally some good news for grain growers today, with international competition driving a big surge in wheat prices for the 2006-07 season.
AWB has released its first price estimates for wheat delivered to the national pool next harvest, with the benchmark Australian Premium White Wheat sitting at $222 a tonne, up $30 on last season.
National Pool manager David Johnson says while prices can still change, Australia is in a good position to capitalise on lower world production figures.
"We have a much stronger fundamental story around hard wheats in particular at the moment, with the US hard red winter crop experiencing some production difficulties," he said.

Expensive feed grain prices impact on graziers
Graziers buying grain to feed livestock this winter are feeling the pinch, with prices continuing to rise.
Dry conditions, higher petrol prices and strong global grain prices are all affecting the cost of feed grain.
Ron Storey from Australian Crop Forecasters says the success of grain-fed beef exports is also putting more demand on supply.
"Our demand here for grain domestically is being underpinned very, very solidly by a very strong feedlot cattle market, with grain-fed beef being in strong demand where BSE has given Australia pretty much by most of the market," he said.

Aust Farm Institute urges drought policy reform
The latest conclusions on drought policy reform, prepared for the Australian Farm Institute, say farmers should be encouraged to be better prepared for drought and governments need a major overhaul of how financial assistance is provided.
Several experts have prepared papers for the Institute and most agree that current drought policy is too focused on crisis management.
Financial adviser Rob Brown argues the policies penalise farmers who run their business in ways to cope with drought.
"If you have prepared, in fact if you've done the things that are the objectives of the drought policy, then you won't be eligible," he said.
And while there is a belief that government policy can actually worsen the wellbeing of farmers and waste resources, others say that fewer farmers are asking for help because of better farm management.
Linda Botterill from the University of NSW believes an income based loan scheme would be simpler and more effective at helping farmers through drought, and be less of a knee-jerk reaction from government.

Suspected illegal fishermen head to Broome for questioning
Six Indonesian fishermen suspected of poaching the sea cucumber trepang, have been taken to Broome for questioning by Australian Customs.
The Navy intercepted the fishermen at the weekend on a boat near Scotts Reef, 250 kilometres off the north-west coast of Western Australia.
Customs spokesman Peter Costantino claims they were caught with the sea cucumber on board.
"There was a small quantity of trepang found on board the vessel when the Navy boarded it and the fishermen were actively fishing at that time and diving on the reef," he said.
"The vessel started to be towed into Broome, but unfortunately broke up. The six fishermen were transported to the HMAS Larrakia and the vessel was destroyed at sea."

Wild rivers legislation will hamper development: groups
Graziers and Indigenous leaders on the Cape York Peninsula say future development of the region will be stifled by the Queensland Government's new wild rivers legislation.
The draft policy aims to protect 19 of the state's pristine river catchments, by introducing restrictions on agriculture, aquaculture and grazing.
Head of the Cape York Institute, Noel Pearson, says pastoralists and traditional landowners need to work together to fight the policy and environmentalists.
"We find ourselves in a position where the Greens no longer respect the fact people need economic development and the cattle industry in this region, and they've been winning," Mr Pearson said.

Groote Eylandt given Indigenous protection status
Australia's third largest island is being declared an Indigenous Protected Area (IPA) today.
Stakeholders have gathered to celebrate on Groote Eylandt in Northern Territory waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Under the agreement, the traditional owners of Groote Eylandt who speak Anindilyakwa will manage their land for conservation and heritage values.
Land Council Chairman Tony Wurramarrba says a local manganese mine is part of the plan.
"Virtually means that we can look after our land, more efficiently. We are in a very unique situation here on an island," he said.
"We don't have any feral animals that they do have on the mainland. One of the main changes that we see (is that ) we (will) have more control over our land.

McGuigan Simeon may extend fruit contract suspension
McGuigan Simeon Wines says contracts with grape growers in the Murray Valley and Riverland are likely to remain suspended until after next harvest.
Supply agreements involving 160 growers were placed on hold in December last year, due to a national oversupply.
A large amount of fruit was left to rot in vineyards or sold below the cost of production.
Mike Stone from Murray Valley Winegrowers says growers are devastated by the decision to extend the suspension and now have to consider how to manage their vineyards.
"Growers have been given plenty of notice unlike in 2005 when they were told in December two months before the 06 harvest that their fruit was to be suspended," he said.

Winemakers group downgrades vintage estimates
The Winemakers Federation has downgraded this season's vintage estimates by 79,000 tonnes.
Australia's total tonnage has fallen to 1.486 million tonnes, slightly down on last year.
Chief executive Stephen Strachan says early figures released last month did not take into account the amount of fruit that would not be harvested.
"The vintage came in at about 4 per cent down on last year's record level," he said.
"You'd probably recall that we've had two record season's in a row, given that there's been quite a significant surplus in place in the industry I think everyone was hopeful we'd have a vintage that was a bit lower this year and it has been.
That said though there's been a lot of fruit left on the vine or worked into the ground and had that all been processed we probably would have had another record this year."
Meanwhile the national wine grape grower body will put forward plans for a $60 million revival package at an industry summit in Melbourne on Friday.
Mark Mckenzie from Wine Grape Growers Australia says the proposal would take at least 600,000 tonnes of grapes out of production over the next two years, to ease the industry oversupply.
Mr McKenzie says the money could be generated by levies, and used to pay growers to put their vineyards into hibernation.
"Effectively it's 15,000 hectares at $2,000 so we're talking about $30 million a year each year for two years - a $60 million package," he said.

Barraba residents cautiously welcome mining company plans
Residents at Barraba, in the north-west of New South Wales, have cautiously welcomed a mining company's plans to extract minerals from the old Woodsreef asbestos mine.
The Sydney-based International Minerals Corporation has been granted an exploration licence worth hundreds of millions of dollars, which could involve a new magnesium metal and silica production plant at the mine.
The site near the town was abandoned in 1983.
Former mayor Shirley Close hopes the deal will go ahead, bringing up to 100 new jobs to the region.

Disease outbreak hits abalone industry
The abalone industry in south-west Victoria says it will take at least 12 months to recover from an outbreak of the herpes-like virus, ganglioneuritis.
Four abalone farms have been hit by the disease.
Tim Rudge from Allestree Coastal Seafarms at Portland says it appears the outbreak came from wild breeding stock, and is a severe setback.
"So we've had to lay people off and the other unfortunate thing is that in the south-west here we have developed a fantastic relationship here with the two local processors," he said.

Dairy operator seeks investor funds
The developers of a large, new dairy venture in South Australia are trying to attract cash from the managed investment sector.
Believed to be the first scheme of its kind in the state, the $15 million project at Tintinara, south of Adelaide, follows investor interest in vineyards, olive and blue gum plantations.
Developer Peter Ryan says high demand from milk processors and steady returns to farmers are making the dairy industry more attractive to investors.
"International indicators are good, here in Australia projections for demand continue to exceed projections for supply," he said.

Forecaster offers winter rain hope
With a lot of seed in the ground and many grain growers looking for vital follow-up rains, long-range weather forecasters are offering some hope this winter.
While the Bureau of Meteorology is predicting a drier than average season, others are tipping better conditions, particularly for the southern states.
Queensland-based Hayden Walker, who predicts the weather up to 18 months in advance, reckons this winter will be wetter than last year, although patchy.
'It's going to be a sort of topsy-turvy, or spasmodic, winter. Queensland will have light rains during June, with moderate falls in July, [and] probably get some reasonable falls on a finishing note in August," he said
"NSW will be looking at light to moderate rains in June and some moderate to reasonably good falls for the balance of winter.

SA growers to plant record crop
South Australian grain growers are set to plant a record area of crop after a good start to the season.
Authorities estimate plantings of around 3.83 million hectares, with 70 per cent already in the ground.
Primary Industries SA consultant Peter Fulwood says, with good conditions and yields, the crop could be worth up to $1.1 billion.
"We've had that earlier start, which has certainly encouraged farmers, and the price of wheat has certainly increased," he said.
"I think principally it's probably been the early start that has encouraged farmers to get in and put in an extra paddock here and there.

VFF backs change to single desk
The Victorian Farmers Federation (VFF) has joined the growing number of organisations calling for change to the single desk for wheat exports.
Under the VFF's plan, AWB would be forced to split to make the single desk more accountable.
AWB International would retain its monopoly on exporting wheat from the national pool, but the domestic arm, AWB Limited, would lose any commercial influence over exports.
Grains Group president Ian Hastings is looking for support from the peak Grains Council of Australia.
"The sort of things that are in our discussion paper, in our model, are the sorts of things that are absolutely dear to all growers around Australia," he said.

Qld leasehold agreement sealed
The Queensland Government and lobby group Agforce have after four years finally reached a new agreement for leasehold land, which is expected to provide more certainty for graziers.
Some conservation groups have argued that the maximum time for a lease should be 10 years.
Brett De Hayr from Agforce says the Government has agreed to 30, 40 and 50 year tenures.
"The frame work is basically 30 years for leases deemed to be in poor condition, 40 years for leases in good condition and the component that we think is actually most attractive in this is the ability for 50 year leases to be granted where people go over and above their duty of care," he said.

Fleece samples could face phase-out
Displaying fleece samples at wool auctions could be a thing of the past under moves to change the way the raw fibre is sold.
The Australian Wool Testing Authority is developing an objective measurement selling system, which will provide more detailed descriptions of wool instead.
The authority's Ian Ashburn says the trial is being driven by wool brokers, but there is some buyer support as well.
"The main feedback has been quite positive from the brokers. Like I said, we have been approached, because of our independence to undertake these activities, from brokers and some buyers in the past six to 12 months," he said.

Joint NT, WA pearling regulation agreed
The pearling industry will be regulated as one entity under a memorandum of understanding signed between the Northern Territory and Western Australia.
Most companies operate across both jurisdictions, stretching from the Territory's English Company Islands near Gove, to Exmouth in the Pilbara.
Captain Christopher Cleveland of Arafura Pearls says the agreement provides a platform to streamline regulations.
"There are some companies like ourselves, which don't have any involvement in Western Australia," he said.

Qld budget spends big on services
Health, education and infrastructure dominate the Queensland Budget.
The Treasurer says it is the biggest and highest ever level of spending for those key areas.
For the farm sector, the focus is on the 'Blueprint for the Bush', a 10-year program for the regions west of the Great Divide.
This year sees $150 million allocated for the plan.
The Primary Industry Minister says his department's budget has been boosted by $11 million and he will be employing an extra 100 officers by Christmas.
The Opposition disputes that that is the case and says there has in fact been a cut to the department of $28 million.

NSW Budget rural transport funding disappoints
Farmers in New South Wales say they are disappointed with a lack of money for rural rail and roads in the state Budget.
Posting a deficit of almost $700 million, the Government has increased spending for primary industries, natural resources and rural infrastructure.
Jock Laurie from the New South Wales Farmers Association says it was a wasted opportunity.

Mango growers warn of labour shortage
Mango growers in the Northern Territory are warning of another labour shortage this harvest.
Growers have told a Senate inquiry this week that guest workers from the Pacific islands should be allowed into Australia to help fill shortfalls.
Darwin grower Peter Delis says the inquiry told them no evidence of a labour shortage has been presented so far.
"The industry is a bit perplexed by this because there has been plenty of people that have made representation since 1996, where there is acknowledgment that there is a labour shortage issue in horticulture," he said.
"So the simple issue is absolutely, it's just where we can source the people.
"Last year was one of the lightest years on record, even with the increased number in trees.

Senate inquiry may consider Timor labour
East Timor could join the list of potential Pacific nations to provide workers to Australia.
Tasmanian Senator Guy Barnett says if the need for labour is demonstrated, the inquiry will be broadened to include countries to Australia's north.
"The terms of reference includes the Pacific and the Pacific islands, and clearly having been in the Northern Territory there is obviously the view, that has been put to us, is that there should be consideration given to Timor and further north into Asia," he said.

Educate young to become good growers, wine judge urges
Turbulent times in the grape growing sector are not deterring younger people from planning a future in the wine industry.
There has been a National Wine Schools Show in Adelaide this week, where students from around the country have showcased more than 70 wines and voiced confidence in the future of the sector.
Wine critic and head judge Philip White says it is important to educate young people on the current problems so they can deal with similar scenarios when they take over the family vineyard in years to come.
"These kids live, if they're in wine regions, live in the face of the glut. They can see their grapes, their dad's grapes, hanging on the fence, they're not getting sold," he said.
"This is an essential thing for them to understand the other end of the cycle.

Hopes Landcare deal will revive movement
The first Landcare sister partnership has been established, as the movement looks at ways to reinvent itself.
The Tasmanian-based Tamar NRM and Victoria's Woady Yaloak Catchment Group will share their knowledge, and members hope the link will give them more independence and clout on the national stage.
Chairman of the Victorian group, Michael Rowe, believes other groups will be watching the experiment.
"I hope so and I hope some of them will follow suit because Landcare seems to be stagnating in some areas a little bit," he said.

Big harvest, good prices cheer cane growers
New South Wales sugarcane growers have begun one of the biggest harvests the state has ever seen.
After a tough few years, growers and millers are reporting high yields, high sugar content and strong world prices.
Rick Beattie, from the New South Wales Sugar Milling Co-op, says the state's three mills expect to crush 2.6 million tonnes of cane.
"Early indications from the Broadwater season are good yields and really good sugar, which is fantastic," he said.

Fuel prices more urgent than nuclear power, say farmers
The National Farmers Federation says the Federal Government needs to urgently tackle high fuel prices, ahead of developing nuclear power.
It is supporting another government inquiry into alternative fuels, which will look at whether a commercial biofuel industry is viable.
NFF president Peter Corish says many farm petrol and diesel bills have risen 70 per cent since 2004, and urgent action is needed to promote alternative fuels.
"There are real opportunities for a number of our agricultural industries and certainly our view is that both need to be focussed on but probably the opportunities that exist from biofuels are more immediate than will come from the nuclear debate," he said.
Meanwhile, ethanol production has been flagged as a potential new industry for Australia's biggest irrigation scheme.
Consultants from Perth and Brazil are looking at the viability of growing sugar cane in the second stage of the Ord River Irrigation Scheme, in Western Australia's far north.

Call for more climate research to maintain wheat production
There is a warning today that wheat production could fall by 15 per cent and cost the nation $1 billion over the next 30 years unless the grains industry steps up research into managing climate change.
A study of five major grain growing areas show a drop in production of between 5 per cent and 25 per cent, with shorter growing periods and higher threats from diseases and pests as the country gets warmer and drier.
Professor Peter Grace from the Institute of Sustainable Resources in Queensland, says farmers may need to look to new wheat varieties and better use natural resources like water.
"Drought resistance is probably the number one area we need to get into in Australia," he said.
"We have a long history of scientists who have done a lot of work in traditional plant breeding in drought resistance and have been very successful, so we're well positioned to meet what's going to happen in the next 30 to 50 years.
"Global warming is here, that is a proven fact. Farmers play a role in that as well by moving towards conservation tillage practices, so farmers are in the driver's seat."
Meanwhile, Western Australia's grain handler and marketer the CBH Group is upbeat about the winter growing season, even though many areas desperately need rain.
CBH has released its first crop yield estimate for the year, with a ballpark figure of 11.6 million tonnes.
Operations manager David Fienberg says CBH's predictions are largely on good summer sub-soil moisture reserves across broadacre regions.
"What we do is, we try and collect as much on-ground intelligence in terms of being really well set-up for those from the summer rains," he said.
"And there is fantastic sub-soil moisture there in the majority of the state.

Tough season ahead for WA sheep producers
Western Australian sheep producers are being urged to buckle up for a tough season.
There is no green feed in the southern half of the state, apart from extreme lower west and south coastal areas, and no rain in sight.
Livestock numbers at saleyards are rising as farmers destock bare paddocks.
Sheep management consultant Andrew Ritchie says graziers need to move soon.
"We have to take it on board mentally first that it is now a poor season and has been a poor season for at least two weeks," he said.

Big turnout tipped fo Farmfest
Despite poor seasonal conditions, consumer confidence is strong at one of Queensland's biggest agricultural field days.
Organisers of the three-day Farmfest near Toowoomba say they are on target for about 80,000 visitors, even though the region has had less than 20 millimetres of rain since the start of the year.
Barry Harley says producers are still opening their wallets.
"And although I don't believe there's still too many people rushing in and buying a $200,000 tractor on the site, the orders are very genuine and there is a tag on it when it rains, but some of the smaller items like quad bikes and silos and bits and pieces - huge sales have actually been recorded," he said.

US beef trade with S Korea on hold
US plans to resume its beef trade with South Korea are on hold over new concerns about American abattoirs.
Exports were to begin this week, but officials are concerned beef destined for South Korea will be processed in the same plants as beef from foreign animals, or cattle over 30 months of age.
Andrew Negline from Cargill Beef Australia says the delay will just create more uncertainty in the market.
"We know the US is coming back in, from Australia's point of view we need to see that re-entry rather than later to take the uncertainty out of the market," he said.
"Their buying habits have gone on hold if you like and you can imagine there's a lot of traffic between Korea and the US in anticipation of the market opening up from the US.
"There have also been a lot of offers out of the US well below the Australian market price."

Food origin labelling standards come into effect
From today it is compulsory for retailers to identify the country of origin of fresh food.
Fresh fruit, vegetables, nuts and seafood will have to be clearly labelled.
Mike Redmond from the Virginia Horticulture Centre in South Australia says the industry will now push for labelling of frozen, packaged and processed food.
"Look it's about giving the consumer the right to choose whether they're going to buy an Australian product and all the good things that go with that like all our food safety standards which are some of the most rigorous in the world, and they get to choose," Mr Redmond said.

Wood exporter dumps bid for global softwood market
After two years of planning, Australia's oldest woodchip exporter has abandoned its bid to enter the global softwood market.
A glut of softwoods is looming after an infestation of the North American timber beetle in Canada.
Vince Phillips from South East Fibre Exports at Eden, in New South Wales, says world prices have been forced 20 per cent below Australian production costs.

McGuigan vineyard plans concern SA grape growers
Grape growers in South Australia's Riverland are concerned about plans by McGuigan Simeon Wines to develop a 400-hectare vineyard.
The company wants vines at Wentworth, in south-western New South Wales to be in full production by 2009-2010.
The news comes just days after 160 growers were told their contracts with the winery will remain suspended for next harvest.
Chris Byrne from the Riverland Wine Grape Growers Association says the type of development is detrimental to the whole industry.
"We have made the point that unless the industry with their help gets right behind the sort of strategic planning that we are encouraging and does something as an industry about rationalising, restructuring and supporting the growers that have built the industry, then that whole proposal is really counter productive to our interests," he said.
There was a 10 per cent jump in the amount of wine exported from Australia in the 12 months to the end of May, to a record 726 million litres.
The Wine and Brandy Corporation says the value of exports grew slightly to almost $2.8 billion, despite prices dropping 34 cents per litre.

E Timor looters destroy rice, maize reserves
Looters in the East Timor capital of Dili have destroyed more than 40 tonnes of rice and maize seed reserves.
The seed normally supports thousands of subsistence farmers across five districts.
The government has warned people not to eat the seed because it has been treated for pests and diseases and to encourage rapid early growth.
East Timorese Minister for Agriculture, Estanislau Da Silva, says more will urgently be needed for next year's crop.
"Several thousand - at least up to five to six districts - especially subsistence farmers they will suffer if we don't have those seeds readily available (by) I would say no later than September because then we will use October to distribute it," the Minister said.

Thieves target banana plantations
Soaring banana prices are making the fruit attractive to thieves at plantations near Coffs Harbour, in New South Wales.
Three thefts have been reported so far, with a shortage of fruit due to damage caused by cyclone Larry in north Queensland.
Tony Heidrich from the Banana Growers Council says it is likely to be more than a one-man operation, given the size of the stolen bunches of bananas.
"It's possibly an under-reported crime. I think there's a perception out there in the community that it's a soft crime with the perception that nobody's getting hurt as a result of a crime," he said.

Cooler change disrupts cows' milk production
A cold snap across south-eastern Australia is even affecting the cows at Hamilton, in Tasmania's Derwent Valley.
With temperatures plunging to minus three degrees celsius, and even minus 5.8 degrees celsius overnight on Tuesday, the dairy cows on Dave Jones' farm have dropped a litre-and-a-half of milk a day.
He says frozen machinery is causing long delays in milking, disrupting the cows' regular milking and pasture routines.
"For the last three or four mornings we've tarped the whole dairy in and we've got a little bit of a heater in there which warms it up by about a degree, but for the last three mornings we've spent the first two to three hours defrosting the machines and getting all the electronics working," Mr Jones said.

AWB seeks Federal Court ruling on documents
Wheat exporter AWB has returned to the Federal Court today, asking it to decide which documents before the oil-for-food inquiry are protected by legal professional privilege.
Last month the Federal Court ruled AWB's apology document was not covered and could be made public.
The court also ruled that Commissioner Terence Cole had the power to decide whether other documents before the inquiry, including AWB's own internal investigation of the oil-for-food program, were protected.

Tassie growers want higher forward grain prices
Tasmanian grain growers are unhappy with forward contracts for feed grain for the coming harvest.
Crosby Lyne from the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association says average wheat and barley feed grain prices at $190 to $195 a tonne are not on parity with mainland prices, even allowing for freight.
He says the island's forward grain prices should be higher, given lower world production and dry conditions putting pressure on yields.
"We believe Tasmanian grain growers aren't being offered enough for their grain for the coming harvest," he said.

Wine industry to solve its own oversupply problem
The wine industry says it will not ask the Federal Government for a financial bail out and will try to solve the grape glut itself.
Industry bodies, leading wine companies and federal and state governments are meeting in Melbourne today to try to find a way through the oversupply problems embattling the industry.
Stephen Strachan from the Winemakers Federation of Australia believes the sector can fix its own mess.
"I don't think there'll be any silver bullets and I don't think we'll come out this afternoon saying we've got a solution to get through this surplus next year, it's just not going to happen," he said.

Summit debates rural health plan
A plan to train rural doctors as specialists is being debated at a health summit in the southern Queensland town of Chinchilla today.
The Rural Doctors Association's president, Dr Ross Maxwell, says there is still a massive shortage of doctors and an insufficient intake of students to meet demand.
He is supporting a plan to train doctors to be specialists in rural areas and have general knowledge of obstetrics, anaesthetics, Indigenous health and surgery.

Aust urged to take more responsibility for uranium waste
Australia has been told it needs to take more responsibility for the waste produced from exporting uranium.
About 40 per cent of the world's uranium stocks can be found in Australia and it is shipped to the US, Japan and Europe for use in nuclear power.
A founder of Greenpeace but now one of the world's main supporters of the nuclear industry, Dr Patrick Moore, says Australia should consider using nuclear power.
But he says the nation must take more responsibility for dealing with nuclear waste.
"I think you wave it goodbye at the dock and wash your hands of any responsibility for what goes on in the world," he said.

Water sales should be treated as capital gain, say Nationals
Farmers and irrigators could be taxed at a lower rate for any water they sell under the National Water Initiative after lobbying from the National party.
Former Nationals leader John Anderson met with the Prime Minister yesterday, arguing water sold to the scheme should be treated as a capital gain rather than income, attracting a lower tax rate.
Mr Anderson says taxing the water at premium rates is unfair.
"This is about farmers feeling that the Government is going to keep good faith with them," he said.

Eastern states begin to offload stock
We heard yesterday about WA graziers offloading stock with the dry conditions, 
and the trend is also starting to appear in western New South Wales and the Victorian Mallee.
About 8,000 ewes and wethers were offered at a special sheep sale at Swan Hill yesterday.
Livestock agent Cameron Mckay says many farmers in the region are supplementary feeding their stock and desperately need rain.
"Western New South Wales probably had a better start than the Mallee but now with continuing dry conditions the feed that has germinated is drying up and the frosty conditions it's also not helping growing conditions at all," he said.
There was a very slight recovery in wool prices this week, with the benchmark eastern market indicator up one cent to 728 cents a kilogram clean.

Scientists to test new bait chemical
Experts say a new chemical to be tested next week has the potential to change the way some of Australia's pest animals are controlled.
The Invasive Animal Cooperative Research Centre says the poison, PAP, was originally designed by the US military, and can be used on wild dogs, feral pigs and foxes.
Research scientist Dr Ricky Spencer says the trials will test the antidote component of the chemical, which is something the current poison known as 1080, does not have.

No quick answer to cane toads, say scientists
Scientists have been meeting in Brisbane this week to work out how to beat the cane toad problem.
More than 40 researchers have shared their work at the national cane toad workshop, and heard evidence of how the toxic toad is adapting to its environment.
Ideas thrown up include bio-control methods and repelling devices, and Dr Tony Robinson from the CSIRO says while there is some inspiring work being done, there's still no magic answer.
"We're talking five to seven years, I mean that's the sort of range for any of those projects, we can't offer any immediate solution to the cane toad problem, which is frustrating," he said.

Quick growing kingfish trial under way in SA
Under a project in South Australia, captive kingfish will be tricked into doubling their growth rate, by having an extra long summer.
Port Lincoln-based company Clean Seas will work with a Danish company to try to halve the time it takes to grow a kingfish to restaurant size.
Instead of being kept in sea cages, Marcus Stehr from Clean Seas says the fish will live in onshore tanks at Arno Bay.

Woolly cattle open small opportunity for hobby farmers
Two cattle producers in New South Wales are trying to downsize their cattle to produce a miniature breed which can also be shorn like a sheep.
Brendan and Yolana Haverfield breed Galloway cows on their hobby farm near Sutton in the southern highlands.
The cows are between 100 and 120 centimetres high, and apart from being extremely docile, the couple say their hair is like cashmere wool.
"It's a Scottish breed, from the Galloway area of Scotland, good for beef, they can be milked, also their hair can be spun like wool.

Farmers fire up for Finke fun
Pastoralists south of Alice Springs have a chance to forget about the lack of rain this weekend at the biggest event on their social calendar.
The 31st Finke Desert Race involves hundreds of off road vehicles and motorbikes, tackling a track which starts just south of the Alice, and ends up in the small outback community.
Billy Hayes from Deep Well Station says everyone looks forward to the race as a chance to catch up with family and friends.
"You know there's not too many pastoralists that I know south of Alice that don't take the weekend off to come and watch the Finke Desert Race or, you know, a lot of them have got family or family members competing in it as well," he said.

Loss of GPS signal causes problems for grain growers
Farmers are experiencing major problems with their global positioning systems (GPS) because two US military satellites have been taken out of service.
Many grain growers use GPS technology to help them sow crops in the most efficient way, pinpointing crop rows to within centimetres.
But the loss of signal is now causing major accuracy problems and drop-outs, particularly in the middle of the afternoon.
Phil Harris from GPS-Ag in South Australia does not know when the problem will be fixed.
"It's unfortunate at the time that it is happening and of course there's still a lot of farmers out there seeding ... now there are a lot of farmers have commenced on their spray program," he said.

Childers farm tested for cane smut
There are fears that an exotic disease discovered on a sugarcane farm in south-east Queensland could be the devastating cane smut.
Queensland's Department of Primary Industries has quarantined a property near Childers after suspect plants were discovered late last week.
Cane smut, which can stunt growth and cause production losses of between 20 and 30 per cent, is considered the highest exotic disease risk for sugarcane in Australia.
While the Canegrowers Organisation says the disease has not been confirmed, general manager Ian Ballantyne says the industry is prepared.
"Canegrowers are members of a thing called Plant Health Australia and through Plant Health Australia we bring together BSES, state and federal governments, ourselves, and other parties who are interested and have an affect on disease incursion," he said.
"We've learnt a lot I think over the years from citrus canker and things like the popia fruit fly and now we think it's better to overreact early than under-react."

Rain hits NSW cropping areas
Cropping areas in New South Wales have received their first major rainfall for the season.
Conditions took a turn for the better on the same day last year and while the rain was not as heavy this time, it was just as welcome.
Cereal cropping producers across inland New South Wales were facing another bleak season, with no rainfall during autumn across the majority of the state.
This changed on Saturday. Most inland areas received between 10 and 30 millimetres, with the majority of the cropping belt receiving around the old inch mark.
Many tractors have started up this morning, to get the winter crop in.
Subsoil moisture levels are still very low to non-existent and so crops will again be reliant on in crop rainfall.
Michael Matthews from Young says the rain does bring hope.

US lowers wheat production forecast
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has again lowered its 2006 and 2007 wheat production forecast, at the same time as grain prices soar.
Production estimates now total just over 1.8 billion bushels, or more than 48 million tonnes.
Last month's US wheat forecast was down 11 per cent from the previous marketing year.
Now, USDA World Agriculture Outlook Board chairman Gerald Bange says continued dry conditions have cut the 06/07 forecast by 14 per cent, and stocks by nearly 25 per cent.
"And as a result of that, we are in fact, seeing a stronger price," he said.
"The price outlook now calls for about $3.90 at the midpoint which is up nearly 50 cents from the 2005-06 years and would, in fact, be the highest price since the $4.30 that was recorded in 1996, contributing to lower US wheat exports, forecast off about 100 million bushels, at about 900 million bushels.
The USDA report caught commodity traders in Australia offguard.
Tony Smith from Plum Grove says no one was expecting such significant changes.
"Well, in the first two minutes, the market reacted as expected," he said.
"The futures exchanges opened up, the markets went straight up and then within two minutes everyone, including myself, was caught by surprise because they just fell in a heap.

No bail-out package for grape growers
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has refused to bail out the nation's struggling grape growers, saying the Government is not to blame for the current oversupply.
Ahead of a national wine summit held in Melbourne on Friday, industry groups were looking for partial compensation from the Government to help growers mothball or hibernate their vines.
But Mark McKenzie from Winegrape Growers Australia says the proposals were not even put on the table, and it is a disappointing result.
"The Minister made it clear that it's an industry issue the industry needs to sort itself out," he said.
"Outside the framework of what's currently available there wasn't anything special put on the table other than additional funding to scope the nature of the issue to provide more information to growers to allow them to make those commercial decisions for themselves going forward."
In the west, many grape contracts are coming to an end, and John Griffiths from the WA Wine Industry Association says the situation is fragile.
While warm climate growing areas have already been hit hard, with fruit left on the vine, the oversupply problem is expected to hit cooler areas over the next two years.
Mr Griffiths says the real crunch for WA is yet to come.
"Even if the news itself isn't great it's better that it's clear.
"You're either industry and your going to make some profits or your probably ought to get out. "

Telcos urged to express interest for bush broadband
The Federal Government has called for expressions of interest from telecommunications companies who can provide broadband Internet services to regional areas.
The $1.1 billion Connect Australia package aims to improve services outside the capital cities.
Industry analyst Paul Budde says telcos should not be competing for business, but allocated a region to ensure wider coverage.
"People in regional Australia should not have to pay more for that sort of service than people in metropolitan areas, this is infrastructure this is not luxury, everybody needs it, and therefore it has to be treated as such," he said.

Rural Australians honoured for Queen's Birthday
Rural Australians have been well represented in the Queen's Birthday Honours list.
A well-known grazier from north-west Queensland says he is surprised at being named a Member of the Order of Australia.
Former National Party president Don Mcdonald from "Devoncourt Station" near Cloncurry has been recognised for his services to regional health, agriculture, infrastructure and politics.
"I'm delighted to have received it, I'm just in total disbelief that this sort of thing would happen because I don't see myself as having done anything more than so many other people who live in the bush do, you know, to help their communities," he said.
Fellow former Nationals president, Helen Dickie has also been named a Member of the Order of Australia.
Being awarded a Medal in the Order of Australia has not silenced Victorian dairy farmer Ann Jarvis in her criticism of the Federal Government's user-pays higher education policy.
Mrs Jarvis was awarded for her service to education, the dairying industry, women in agriculture and the community of the Kiewa Valley.
She says the Federal Government has a moral obligation to put more money into tertiary education.
"I think that we've forced our rural children away from universities in the last 10 years," she said.
"The cost to attend university is enormous. I dont' believe that brains necessarily only belong to city people. I think there is a great deal of intellectual brain drain from country areas because people can't afford to avail themselves of tertiary level education."
Broken Hill Identity, "Brushman of the Bush" and well known former ABC TV outback adventurer Jack Absalom received an Order of Australia for services to painting and charitable works.
Winemakers are also feature prominently, with honours going to South Australia's Brian Barry and the Hunter Valley's Bruce Tyrrell, who believes the industry will turn around.
"Oh yeah it's amazing you know, you go from being the darling to the devil," he said.
"The Australian wine industry is copping a heap of bad press at the moment, but behind that is still this phenomenol growth.

Desert race comes to an end
Australia's most challenging off-road race is coming to an end at Alice Springs.
Hundreds of competitors in the Finke Desert Race have pitched their buggies, cars and motorbikes at 450 kilometres of some of the toughest terrain in the country.
It is windy, freezing cold and extremely dusty at the 31st Finke Desert Race.
Only a third of competitors usually complete the track, which is full of bulldust, desert oak trees to dodge and about 70 kilometres of woops which is like driving over thousands of volkswagons in a row.
Already the winners in the buggies have made it home, first place went to father/son team Shannon and Ian Wrench from Warrnambool, Victoria.

Ploughmen dig in at championships
Twenty of Australia's best ploughmen battled for first place at the weekend's National Ploughing Championships in Tasmania.
Pitting their technical precision against the clock, farmers also had to work in dense fog while competing at Cressy, in the state's north.
Two Victorians were the winners, Adrian Tilling for conventional ploughing, and David Smith for reversible ploughing, and both will represent Australia at the world titles next year.
Rhonda Smith from the World Plough Organisation says success all depends on the day.
"Ploughmen can plough good on one day and draw a good plot and then some ploughmen can plough under pressure," she said.

Cane smut found on Qld property
Authorities have confirmed the discovery of the exotic disease sugar cane smut at a farm near Childers, in south-east Queensland.
At the start of another cane crush, it is a massive blow to the sector, which has been enjoying good prices.
The infected property has been quarantined and wider surveillance is underway.
Property owner Joe Russo, who is also the chairman of the Isis District Canegrowers, says it has been a horrible time.
"Not only myself, but the whole family, are quite devastated to hear the news," he said.
"There's no doubt we've all understood the disasterous effects smut can bring, but to have it recorded not only in your district, then to have it on your own property, is of a concern."
The entire cane crop on the east coast will be inspected for the disease.
Queensland has been one of only a few commercial growing regions in the world without cane smut, which can cause major production losses.
Eoin Wallis from research group BSES Limited says the situation is extremely serious, even though only one infected plant has been found.
"At the moment, because we haven't found anymore plants, we are not able to say whether this is a widespread infestation or simply quite local," he said.

Water shortage threatens lettuce supplies
Production of Australian lettuces could drop by up to 60 per cent by Septelettuce shortagember because of a lack of water in storages outside Melbourne.
Southern Rural Water has cut water allocations to the Bacchus Marsh and Werribee irrigation districts to between zero and 5 per cent, leaving growers without water, or using recycled waste water.
One of Victoria's biggest coloured lettuce growers, Frank Ruffo, says the both domestic and export supplies will be hit.
"We use all our water for growing lettuce, salads," he said.
We supply on a national basis around Australia and we also supply overseas so that is going to ruin our export markets, especially when we've managed to take them off the American suppliers.

Results on mad cow disease research may take years
Scientists say it could take years to work out whether there is a new strain of mad cow disease or whether the original virus has mutated.
US researchers have confirmed that two cases of BSE in Texas and Alabama during the past year are a new variety of the disease, which is similar to others in Europe and Japan.
Professor Colin Masters from Melbourne University says it is frustrating for agricultural industries which have to wait for the research before finding out whether they can stop any further spread of the disease.
"So far they're very rare and they've only been found because of this massively increased surveillance," he said.

Wheat growers call for continued government assistance
With a new farm bill on the horizon in the United States, wheat growers there have joined calls for continued government assistance.
The wheat industry is concerned it has a shaky future, after figures showed wheat's portion of the national crop has fallen 10 per cent since the 1980s.
Grower organisations say the wheat industry is at a crossroads with little growth in exports, lower domestic consumption and loss of acres to other crops.
As well, there are concerns that wheat diseases are affecting farmers' profits and there is little research being done on new wheat varieties.
But while the the industry is keen to encourage new research, it has emphasised it must make economic sense for farmers to want to plant wheat in the first place.
According to the US department of agriculture, the wheat sector is facing long term challenges to its profitability, but asking for increased subsidies from government is not the answer.
The USDA says subsidies only artificially increase demand, rather than provide long term solutions.
The industry plans to hold a wheat summit later this year to try to work out how it can stay profitable and competitive in the international market.
The Indian Government has called for tenders to supply 2.2 million tonnes of wheat, after a lack of interest in a 3 million tonne deal last month.
Only 800,000 tonnes was allocated from the original wheat tender, with two thirds expected to be filled by AWB.

Livestock producers warned over feeding requirements
The Western Australian Department of Agriculture is warning livestock producers to either reduce sheep numbers or pay closer attention to feeding requirements.
There is a severe lack of feed due to dry weather and stock deaths have been reported because sheep are not getting enough roughage.
Veterinary officer Marnie Thomas says producers are feeding their sheep lupins as an alternative feed source but they need greater diversity to maintain condition.
"If you've got stock that you can quit, I would definitely be quitting them now because if this dry keeps going, you're going to be looking at supplementary feeding for anywhere up to six weeks from the break of the season, right up to eight weeks, depending on what sort of pasture you've got," she said.

Study looks at heat stress concerns for helmet wearers
Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) is studying how heat stress might affect station workers forced to wear helmets while riding horses.
Graziers across northern Australia have raised concerns that compulsory helmet wearing for employees could increase body temperature and lead to heat stress and fatigue.
With some stations forcing the introduction of helmets as a safety measure, MLA's Wayne Hall hopes the research will lead to better helmet designs.

Cool dry season could mean early Top End mangoes
Cooler than average weather this dry season in the Northern Territory could bring forward the mango harvest.
Night time temperatures across the Darwin rural area have been more than three degrees cooler than average this month.
Flowering is under way across mango orchards of the Top End and extension officer Greg Owens says fruit could mature by mid September.
"The trees were pretty much set up for it from a very small harvest season last year," he said.
"They had good reserves from the tree and having that cold snap follow on from that rain seems to have triggered a lot of trees that were ready to go off.

Farmers call for more help to for biodiesel production
Farmers trying to establish commercially viable biodiesel operations say the Federal Government needs to do more to encourage development.
Victorian farmer Josh Pearse, who has set up a plant at Donald, in the state's west, says taxing biodiesel at the same level as ordinary diesel is a disincentive to farmers making or using it.
He says in the face of rising fuel costs, grain farmers particularly, have a great opportunity to start growing some of the fuel they need for their farms.
"There should be a few more incentives for people to actually get into the biodiesel industry, and even for some sort of tax benefit for farmers and for people to start using biodiesel," he said.

Demand soars for softwood
Australian softwood producers say they are experiencing their highest levels of demand for years, with more shipments of pine woodchips and steadily rising prices.
Growing demand from the Japanese paper industry is driving the export market growth, as the Japanese economy picks up and the consumption of paper and paper products increases.
Phil Lloyd, from South Australian processor Auspine, says the last 12 months have seen demand exceeding supply.

WA finds nifty solution to cane toad menace
A specially trained sniffer dog has been chosen to hunt down cane toads at the border between Western Australia and the Northern Territory.
Nifty, a two-year old female belgian malinois, will begin training immediately and start work in Kununurra from September.
Gaye Mckay from WA's Department of Conservation and Land Management says Nifty is part of an overall plan to keep cane toads out.
"Anything that can stop cane toads from entering WA is a worthwhile investment," she said.

Rural workers at risk of cancer, report shows
A new report has found workers in rural industries like agriculture, forestry and mining are most at risk of developing cancer.
The study by the Queensland Cancer Fund and the University of Sydney has found twice as many people as previously thought are exposed to cancer-causing substances at work, including pesticides, UV rays and dust.
Gordon Gregory from the National Rural Health Alliance, says country workers face a double whammy, because a lack of medical care in the bush can severely reduce the chance of survival.
"Agriculture forestry and fishing are dangerous occupations - but normally we tend to think in terms of accidents," he said.
"Now we have got this report which frankly surprises me that it is also the cause of high rates of cancers.

Snowy Hydro rethinks development plans
Snowy Hydro says it will be forced to borrow heavily, now that its planned privatisation has been scrapped but staff jobs are safe.
The Federal Government scuttled plans to sell the power generator earlier this month.
Managing director Terry Charlton says the sale would have given Snowy Hydro access to extra funds but the company now must rethink its development plans.
"We're looking at increasing our borrowings, cutting back on capital expenditure, cutting back on other expenditures, hopefully being able to defer some expenditure on the scheme and substitute it with other growth opportunities," he said.

Farmsafe maintains cancer risks minimised
A farm safety group has defended the sector's use and management of pesticides after a new report said people in agriculture were among the most at risk of developing cancer.
The study by the Queensland Cancer Fund and the University of Sydney found twice as many people as previously thought faced cancer-causing substances at work, including pesticides, UV rays and dust.
But Jamie Cupples from Queensland-based Farmsafe says risks have been greatly minimised because primary producers must go through chemical accreditation programs.
"We haven't had the evidence that there's a huge rate of cancer in the rural industry being caused by pesticides," he said.

More sugar cane smut cases under investigation
Queensland authorities are investigating possible new cases of the fungal disease sugar cane smut.
The disease, never before found in eastern Australia, has the potential to reduce cane yields by up to 30 per cent.
It was confirmed on a farm near Childers yesterday and further cases are now suspected in another block on the same property.
Chris Adriaansen, from Queensland's Department of Primary Industries, will not say how many plants are affected, but denies smut is here to stay.
"No, no, absolutely not. It may be that we will find sequentially a number of small infestations over a period of you know it could be 12 months or even possibly longer," he said.

Wool campaign targets US market
A test marketing campaign for wool has been launched to try to tap into the billion dollar clothing market in the United States.
Saks of Fifth Avenue and retailer Dillards have been signed to try to educate the US consumer about the benefits of wool by marketing woollen trousers.
The Woolmark company says there is a huge market to be gained from the $6 million investment.
But consultant Graham Lean says the push in the US is misguided and the best way to increase grower returns is to cut costs.

Gold price fall puzzling
Resource analysts are puzzled why the price of gold suffered a meltdown in New York trade overnight.
The price of gold dropped $US44.50 an ounce, its biggest single day drop since 1991.
Hartley's resource analyst Andrew Rowell cannot explain the decline in gold and copper prices.
"We're not actually really sure as to why it's such a big drop. It came off last night in New York, it started at the start of the day and kept going," he said.
"I guess we're at a bit of a loss to see exactly the reasons why it was so pronounced."
In other commodity news, Australia's export earnings from mineral resources fell $1 billion to $21 billion for the March quarter.

Queenslander wins NFF top job
Queenslander David Crombie is the new president of the National Farmers Federation (NFF).
Mr Crombie is the former chairman of Meat and Livestock Australia and former chairman of the Queensland Reds.
Mr Crombie takes over from outgoing president, cotton grower Peter Corish.
Victorian dairy farmer Allan Burgess was the other candidate for the peak farming group's top job.
The announcement was made in Canberra, where farmers from all over Australia and representatives of a wide range of agricultural industries are meeting, to draw up their strategies and priorities for the coming 12 months.
Delegates from around Australia will today be debating the NFF's stand on telecommunications and native vegetation.
The telecommunications debate is timely given the NFF's initial support for the Telstra plan to maintain a presence in rural Australia.

Cold snap takes toll on prawn operator
The cold weather snap in the far north of Western Australia has taken its toll on one aquaculture venture.
Six hundred and sixty thousand prawn fingerlings are feared dead after the spate of cold weather, including overnight lows of eight degrees.
The marine prawns stop feeding at 20 degrees and die at 13 degrees, and owner Ian Crimp says there is not much movement in the tank.
"The water monitor shows the temperature is down to 14.5 at the present time and it's getting pretty low and will be probably devastating for the prawns," he said.
"These little ones might be in the great prawn house in the sky by now. Prawn heaven!"
The rising cost of fuel is also threatening the seasonal harvest of banana prawns.
Some trawlers caught up to 10 tonnes more when authorities extended the season by a fortnight.
But fisherman Ean Casey says the good catches were not enough to cover fuel, competition from cheaper imported prawns, and labour shortages.
"It's been was a worse year than previous years even though we caught more," he said.
"This year we found it very hard to get people. We will probably look at bringing in overseas labour (from Indonesia).

Summer fruit industry looks for Govt support
There are calls for Federal Government support for the summer fruit industry following signals the Taiwanese export market will not reopen in time for next year's harvest.
Exports were suspended late last year because of Taiwanese concerns over a Queensland fruit fly.
Summerfruit Australia's Wayne Boucher fears if exports to Taiwan resume, an extra 10,000 tonnes of stone fruit could flood the domestic market.
"We'd have to say that it is looking highly unlikely that the work that is currently being done will be completed in time for us to get access to the Taiwanese market in time for this season," he said.

New concerns over NSW land clearing laws
Landholders across New South Wales are being warned the Native Vegetation Act will have a far greater impact than was originally thought.
The Act stops broadscale land clearing across the State.
Gabrielle Holmes's family has been prosecuted twice under the Act, without conviction, for the removal of native invasive scrub.

Pricey pup fetches new record
What price would you pay for a good working dog?
Well you can expect to dig even deeper after a Victorian bred kelpie fetched $5,400 over the weekend.
Tasmanian farmer Neil Monks bought the 20-month-old pup sight unseen, and had no qualms at forking out an Australian record amount for the dog, Bagalla Mick.
"The way I look at it there's no limit on the value of a good dog," he said.

Weather takes its toll on farmers
Drought is worsening across south-eastern Australia.
In the New South Wales Murray Valley region, 650 irrigators are now eligible for exceptional circumstance assistance until next January.
In Victoria's north-east, several farmers are shooting sheep, or selling stock below market prices.
Director of Hume Corridor Community Health, Wayne Weaire, is organising community barbeques in the region to support farmers:
"In the last drought we found that people if they became isolated from each other, if they simply worked hard on farm or simply sat around wondering what they could do there were enormous amounts of stress," he said.
"It just has an impact on the whole sense of well being on the family or the individual and we found last time the greatest lesson was how important it is to get out there and talk and get access to information and support from each other and from other agencies."
And cold weather is a problem too.
Citrus growers in the Murray Valley and the Riverland are keeping an eye out for frost damage.
Industry experts claim that damage occurs if the temperature drops below -2 overnight for longer than four hours and that has already happened several times this winter.
Some growers fear a repeat of 1982 when young trees died because of the extreme weather.
Horticulturalist Steven Falivene says growers need to keep in contact with their citrus packer if they believe their fruit has been damaged by frost.
"The real damage happens at say two weeks afterwards," he said.

'Ultra virgin' olive oil technique patented
A Tasmanian olive grower has patented a new oil processing technique to produce what he calls "ultra virgin" olive oil.
Brian Hinson says olives grown in Tasmania's cold climate produce higher than world standard levels of oleic acid, giving an even healthier oil that should attract a premium.
He says the secret to the high oil levels is harvesting early and taking no more than 12 hours from picking to processing.

Incoming farm leader wants united voice for agriculture
Building a united voice for agriculture and raising the community's awareness of farming are just two of the aims for newly elected National Farmers Federation president, David Crombie.
Mr Crombie, a businessman and former chairman of Meat and Livestock Australia, says the NFF's role is to push the farming agenda with government, and emphasise the importance of agriculture to the economy.
He says targeting falling memberships amongst farm organisations is also critical.
"We can't afford division, we can't afford confusing messages coming out of agriculture," he said.
"Look, I'd like to see all farm organisations members of NFF, but once again you have to create a valued proposition for those people, if a producer feels that there's no value in being a member of an organisation then he won't join, quite simply. I think the challenge for farm organisations and for NFF is to create that value proposition."
Outgoing President Peter Corish says the NFF's biggest challenge is to deal with the weak financial position of the organisation's farm body members.

Re-structure talks on the cards for peak seafood group
The future of the nation's peak seafood lobby group is uncertain, after directors placed the Australian Seafood Industry Council into voluntary receivership.
A funding shortfall from voluntary levies and a lack of communication is being blamed for its demise.
Territory representative Rob Fish says the industry is expected to meet within four weeks to discuss re-structuring.
"I am not aware of many industry associations that can work on voluntary contributions," he said.
"Most are levied across the industry, providing with constant budgets, so you can budget across. Without that, I can't see it working myself.

ALP figures back compulsory ethanol levels in fuel
The push to mandate ethanol levels in petrol has a new ally - the ALP, with key Labor figures in New South Wales and Queensland said to be pushing for a 10 per cent biofuel component in fuels.
A motion to that effect was unanimously passed at the NSW Labor conference last weekend..
The Labor move comes as the federal National Party leadership heads in the opposite direction, ruling out any compulsory standards being adopted despite a good deal of backbench and National Party support for biofuels.
The Government doesn't support mandating of alternative fuel because we believe that would have a very likely if not certain market distortionary effect," said Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran.
But NSW Labor MP for Bathurst, Gerard Martin, thinks the move to mandate ethanol levels in fuel is a "no brainer".
He says pressure is being brought to bear on Kim Beazley and the Federal Opposition to get behind a cleaner, cheaper renewable fuel.

Drought tightens grip in NSW
New drought figures have been released for New South Wales, painting a dire picture this winter.
After the lowest May rainfall in 50 years, 89 per cent of the state is now officially drought declared, up from 62 per cent the previous month.

Extending local content rules won't allay Nationals' fears
The chairman of the Federal Government's policy committee on communications says the National party's concerns about cross-media ownership plans would not be allayed by an offer to extend local content rules to regional radio.
Communications Minister Helen Coonan told the National Press Club she is considering forcing regional commercial stations to air a set amount of local production.
Nationals MP Paul Neville, who chaired an inquiry into regional radio, says his party will continue to push for more concessions on the controversial media changes.

Smut-infected cane to be destroyed
More sugar cane smut has been found on a south-eastern Queensland cane farm.
Authorities have confirmed that up to three hectares of smut-infected cane has been found on the already quarantined property near Childers.
With the industry biosecurity plan in full swing, decisions on how to destroy affected cane and whether local sugar mills will be allowed to crush have yet to be made.
Joe Russo, who discovered the disease on his family farm last week, says it is a hot spot of infection and crops will have to be destroyed.

Former wool industry leader backs marketing campaign
A test marketing campaign for wool in the United States is money well spent, according to a former industry leader.
Former senior executive of Wool International Bob Richardson has defended the joint venture with Saks of Fifth Avenue and retailer Dillards.
He says the initial investment of just $6 million will be recouped by growers several times.
Mr Richardson rejects the assertion made by consultant Graham Lean that money spent on promotion has no impact on wool prices.
"Absolutely I do. It is just so simplistic to think that just because there is not that correlation that therefore promotion of wool has not been successful in the past," he said.

Lack of rain blamed for reduction in grain export licences
The lack of winter rain in Western Australia has forced the state's Grain Licensing Authority (GLA) to reduce the number of special export licences it issues this season.
The GLA is responsible for granting special export licences for WA barley, lupins and canola, and has approved just four out of nine licences in the latest round of applications.
Chairman Wayne Obst says with the seeding window fast diminishing, seasonal conditions are too risky to hand out further licences at this stage.
"We looked at nine applications and five were deferred because of the season, some for canola and some for malt barley, because we feel at this stage it would be not appropriate to look at it, when the situation for canola is less than ordinary," he said.

NZ farmers encouraged to head to Tassie
Representatives of a Tasmanian council are in New Zealand at the moment trying to entice farmers to relocate from the land of the big white cloud to the Apple Isle.
The Circular Head Council is distributing a booklet at this week's New Zealand National Agricultural Field Days, giving a regional and economic profile of the northern Tasmanian region.
The council's strategic projects officer, Lisa Nelson, says compared to New Zealand, prime dairy land in Tasmania is almost half the price and any farmers who make the move will have no problem settling in.
"Tasmania's very similar to New Zealand in a lot of respects," she said.

Shorthorn bull sells for record Aust price
A new record has been set at the National Shorthorn Show in Dubbo in New South Wales, with a shorthorn bull selling for $75,000.
The bull was exhibited by the Calrossy and Cowper Schools at Tamworth, and bought by John Nitschke from Hahndorf in South Australia.
Auctioneer Mike Wilson thinks Nero 62K Zee Top, as he is called, may have even gone one better than setting a record Australian shorthorn price.
"I think it's a world record, I know there was a bull in Canada called Signature who made about $US37,000 and I think $75,000 yesterday is a world record price," he said.

Phantom cattle prompt audit of livestock ID system
The Federal Government has ordered an independent audit of Australia's national livestock identification system.
The system allows Meat and Livestock Australia to electronically trace cattle from birth to slaughter using ear and rumen tags, but it has been controversial since its inception 12 months ago.
The Agriculture Minister, Peter McGauran, says he has ordered the audit after criticism from the Australian Beef Association (ABA), which claims there are 11 million 'phantom' cattle on the database that do not exist.
But the minister has warned the ABA against tarnishing the beef industry's reputation.
"Such criticism can potentially harm the industry," he said.

Report at odds with Govt over options for Murray
A draft report by the Productivity Commission, designed to canvass options to re-invigorate the Murray River has found that engineering projects are unlikely to save enough water.
The study finds the best solution is for governments to buy back water for environmental flows.
But Federal Agriculture Minister, Peter McGauran, rejects the idea of governments buying water through licences, allocations or options.
Bernie Wonder, from the Productivity Commission, says science and engineering are not enough to address the shortfall in the Murray River of some 500 gigalitres.
"We do need to go a bit further in terms of finding the quantity of water that has been identified and if we look only to those infrastructure solutions and that is going to be a very expensive way to go," he said.

AWB execs quit
Two more executives have resigned from wheat exporter AWB.
Both men were closely connected to the company's oil for food dealings with Iraq.
Michael Long, currently head of international sales, was in charge of the Middle East desk at the wheat exporter during the oil for food program, and has given evidence to the Cole Inquiry about trading arrangements at that time.
AWB was embarrassed when photos of Mr Long and former chairman Trevor Flugge, appeared in the media showing the men carrying guns on a tour of Iraq.
Charles Stott, currently in charge of Landmark, also appeared at the inquiry and repeatedly denied any knowledge of kickback payments.

Budget not supportive of processors, says farmers association
Tasmanian farmers say last night's state Budget does not do enough to support processors.
Although it describes the Budget as farmer friendly, the Farmers and Graziers Association says processors need relief from payroll and land taxes.
Association executive officer Greg Bradfield says processors of dairy, meat and vegetables are farmers' first-end customers and deserve more support.
"It's very important that they're competitive because they're under a lot of competitive pressure from interstate and overseas so we want to make sure that the whole value chain is competitive so that farmers can get the most out of that value chain as possible," he said.

Minister plays down prospect of banana imports
Banana growers and the Federal Agriculture Minister have rejected media reports that Australians will be eating imported bananas within months.
While there have been calls for imports, because of the high price of bananas after Cyclone Larry destroyed the Queensland crop, the Government is standing by local growers.
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says an import risk asssessment is currently underway, but previous assessments have ruled out imports.
"We will not be in any way susceptible to the temptation to bring in bananas as a short-term risk," he said.
"We know the damage that that could cause to our industry, which would be even more devastating than Cyclone Larry's effects."

Cowra meatworks dispute settled
An industrial dispute at a meatworks in New South Wales, which gained national attention, has been settled.
The Cowra abattoir dismissed a number of employees, offering their jobs back at a much lower pay rates, under the new industrial relations laws.
Under political pressure, the company reinstated the employees under their previous award, while pay negotiations took place.
State Meatworkers Union secretary, Charlie Donzow, says while some workers will receive less money, the pay is much higher than the dismissed workers had been offered.
"The area where they won't gain as much is when the company goes into levels of production over and above the minimum they put in place now," he said.

More smut found in Qld cane
Yet more sugarcane smut has been found in south-east Queensland, forcing the Isis Mill to postpone the start of its crush.
The mill was due to start operating on Monday but yesterday, authorities told a growers' meeting that delaying the crush would give surveillance teams a better chance to determine how widespread the smut problem is.

Mulesing alternatives available from 2007: AWI
Two alternatives to mulesing will be available for farmers by 2007 and 2008 respectively, beating the 2010 deadline set between wool growers and animal rights group PETA.
Wool Research body Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) had its trials set back earlier this year when the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service rejected a key product, collagenase as a biosecurity threat.
But head of blowfly control at AWI, Jules Dorrian, says a new product, producing similar results, has received the all clear.

Retrenched Beaconsfield gold miners urged to head west
Retrenched miners from Tasmania's Beaconsfield gold mine are being lured to Western Australia with the promise of good jobs and a secure lifestyle.
Fifty-two workers were made redundant after the April rock fall that killed one miner and trapped two others.
Western Australian Mines Minister John Bowler says his government has set up a special migration service to assist miners wanting to relocate to the booming resources state.
"We've got heaps of jobs over here, wonderful lifestyle, great to raise your families," he said.
"We're just saying to those workers at Beaconsfield if you haven't got a job and you've got a young family and you want to start anew, Western Australia is a great place to be.

Crop growers desperate for rain
The need for rain across north-west Victoria's grainbelt is now desperate.
A run of severe frosts this week has depleted moisture levels further.
Department of Primary Industries agronomist Rob Sonogan says about 80 per cent of the Mallee's crops are sown and most have germinated.
But he says without rain since the May break, many have failed to develop secondary root systems.
"I've actually sighted a couple of situations, very small areas in paddocks where the crops have actually died," he said.

Snow causes problems for NZ farmers
This week's storms on New Zealand's South Island, which have dumped more than 60 centimetres of snow, have caused management problems for farmers.
Helicopters are delivering emergency supplies to those in more remote communities, including fodder for farm animals.
President of the Mid-Canterbury Federated Farmers Rupert Curd says power is out on the Canterbury Plains and electric fences on dairy farms are on the blink.

GM cotton row heats up
Debate over genetically-modified (GM) cotton in northern Australia is heating up, with two biotechnology companies applying to the Commonwealth regulator for licences.
The Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) rejected a similar proposal four years ago, which means GM cotton cannot be grown commercially in the Australian tropics.
Environmental groups say any new GM cotton could become established as a tropical weed.
But Ord River farmer Rob Boshammer says it is unfair that the north is missing out on the new technology.
"I think it is a very dangerous situation where parts of the country can be allowed to use technology and other parts not," he said.
"It seems totally unfair to me if you live one side of the 26th parallel you can grow GM cotton, if you live a metre the other side of the 26th parallel you can't. It seems to put an economic impost on us."

Farmers views sought about saleyards sale
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is seeking farmers views about the proposed sale of two Victorian saleyards.
The Victorian Livestock Exchange wants to buy yards at Korumburra and Sale but already owns many saleyards in the district.
The ACCC is investigating whether the acquisition will limit competition from other saleyard operators.
And some farmers fear it could lead to the closure of the Korumburra saleyards.

Rodeo nominations sky-rocket
Hundreds of spectators and competitors are expected to descend on the historic Top End town of Pine Creek tomorrow.
After a three year hiatus, the rodeo is back.
The town is also buzzing with the prospect of new gold and iron ore mines opening.
School teacher and rodeo competitor Mary-Ellen Willis says the popularity of the event is growing across the Northern Territory.
"Last year there was a low number of competitors. This year it's just sky-rocketing. We have over 130 nominations so far," she said.

World Cup rivalry breaks out at abattoir
World Cup fever has broken out at an abattoir in north Queensland.
The heckling has started at Mackay's Borthwicks abattoir as Monday morning's soccer game between Australia and Brazil draws nearer.
Borthwicks currently employs 72 Brazilian meat workers who are passionate football fans and the battle lines have been drawn.
"The Brazilians are very cocky, very confident, they think they're going to win easily, so we're giving it back to them," one of the workers said.
"A lot of them, they think things with Brazil will be the same as it was with Japan. It's going to be a hard match," said another.

Specific funding for regional health care proposed
Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile has proposed that Commonwealth funding for health care to the states be conditional on part of it being specifically allocated to regional areas.
Mr Vaile says the state of rural cancer and obstetrics services at the moment is unacceptable.
He says a change in the funding formula would force states and territories to spend more money on rural hospitals in their next funding agreements, starting in 2008.
"The Commonwealth Government has the responsibility to ensure that the taxpayers dollars that we are spending on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia are spent in the most equitable way," he said.

Ag Census expected to show increase in farm numbers
The country's biggest collection of agricultural information is expected to show an increase in the number of farms, despite the drought.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics is asking 190,000 primary producers for production figures and stock numbers for the 2006 Agricultural Census.
The last census, five years ago, identified 130,000 genuine farm businesses operating in Australia.
But the bureau's Allan Nicholls is expecting an extra 30,000 small farms to participate this time.
"They've certainly been there all along but they've been quite small and we haven't been able to pick them up through our normal channels," he said.

Elders seals deal to export beef cattle to Russia
A deal to ship Australian breeding beef cattle to Russia has been signed by pastoral company Elders.
The first shipment of 3,500 cattle is due to leave Australia in July from Portland in Victoria and Fremantle in Western Australia, eventually unloading in Vladivostok, so they can acclimatise before the Northern Hemisphere winter.
The plan is to then increase shipments until about 50,000 Australian cows a year are sent to Russia.

More sugar cane smut found in south-east Qld
Surveillance work over the weekend has uncovered more sugar cane smut in south-east Queensland.
The exotic fungal disease that stunts sugar cane has now been found on at least six more properties near Childers.
Unlike the first few identified hot spots, the latest properties to be confirmed quarantined and 'struck' by sugar cane smut are not from the same farms but they are within a few kilometres of the initial discoveries.
Surveillance work is being stepped up throughout the region and the Isis sugar mill has postponed the start of its crush until next week.
Nearby Bundaberg Sugar has put its harvesting on hold, just for the day, to enable its growers to meet and learn more about the disease.

Retrenched Beaconsfield miners yet to find jobs
Retrenched miners from the Beaconsfield Gold mine in Tasmania say job offers are not exactly pouring in.
Just last week the Western Australian Government was talking up opportunities to try to lure experienced underground operators from Beaconsfield.
But Jerry Kahmann says he has been applying for jobs since the Beaconsfield rock fall two months ago.
He says despite the $8 million Federal Government aid package, he and his mates have been left to their own devices to find new work and he has not yet been offered anything outside Tasmania.
"We're all hearing that there's a great big shortage of skilled miners on the mainland," he said.
"Maybe a position in Cobar, there's another position up in Cannington, Queensland, Bendigo.
"Got in four applications up in Olympic Dam with BHP Billiton themselves, also I've tried to get in with the contractors up there.

New import rules bring India into line with international standards
India's Government has agreed to new rules for wheat imports, as the country struggles to fill a multi-million tonne tender.
Only two companies, including Australia's AWB, put forward successful bids in the last round.
India is hoping its new requirements, which bring it in line with international standards, will attract more interest.

Farmers urged to get involved in carbon trading scheme debate
A report commissioned by the National Farmers Federation says farmers should push to have trees on their properties included in carbon trading schemes.
It says schemes being drawn up by states and territories are likely to have an impact on the cost of power used by farmers but this could be offset by selling carbon credits from farm forestry.
The report's author, Brett Janissen from the Allen Consulting Group, says with a New South Wales scheme already established, farmers need to get involved in the debate now.
"It's not completely clear at this point that the system that states are designing will actually countenance forest sinks," he said.
"It's very likely but my advice to the farmers is to throw their weight behind that to push that over the line.

Melbourne wool auction room lease good news for buyers
An offer by independent wool brokers to take up the lease of Melbourne's auction room has gained the support of buyers.
The Australian Wool Exchange announced last month it was giving up the lease of the Brooklyn wool selling centre.
Peter Morgan, from the Australian Council of Wool Exporters, says the interest of independent brokers is good news for buyers.
"We were quite worried at first but we're delighted that the independent brokers have been able to react as quickly as they have and in the manner that they have," he said.
"What it will mean that it ensures the ongoing of sales here which is the most convenient site for buyers because they've all got, nearly as I said, nearly all got offices here."

Mashes committee winds up
Landholders in the Macquarie Marshes of central western New South Wales have been forced to disband their local management committee because of ongoing drought and a lack of funding.
Scientists say the marsh is the largest nesting site in Australia for waterbirds like egrets, ibis and heron but over the last four years it has been so dry the birds have been unable to nest.
Sue Jones, from the now defunct management committee, says it is a struggle to survive.
"With drought and reduced flows in the river, landholders just cannot keep going," she said.
"They need to at the moment put their time and resources into their own enterprises just to keep themselves afloat.

Irrigators donate water to dying red gums
Irrigators in north-west Victoria have donated a record amount of water to save stressed and dying river red gums.
It is the second year the Mallee Catchment Management Authority (CMA) has coordinated the project.
This year 1.7 gigalitres of water has been donated, enabling seven sites along the Murray River to receive environmental flows.
CMA chief executive Jenny Collins says it is an amazing response considering the economic downturn facing local horticulture.
"They have really showed that they care about the environment by donating their water in this sort of fairly severe situation for them," she said.

Farmers may have to customise products
Farmers are being urged to sell the health benefits of their products if they want to get ahead in an increasingly competitive market.
A conference in Melbourne, looking at the future of food, has been told consumers will pay more for produce that offers added benefits like higher calcium or antioxidants.
Dairy researcher Peter Hobman says it is not unthinkable that farmers will have cows producing specific healthy types of milk.
"There is certainly the potential for individual dairy farms or collections of dairy farms to produce milk that is customised for an end use," he said.

US sugar quota changes mooted
The US sugar quota program has long been a source of frustration for Australian producers and exporters.
But changes may be in store.
With full implementation of the North American free tree agreement by 2008, US Agriculture Under-Secretary JB Penn says a flood of Mexican sugar could force changes.
"The border, being completely open in 2008, will mean that we will have to modify the program in some way Â we can't continue to operate a supply-control program if you can't control the supply," he said.

Abrolhos Islands able to handle day tourists, says researcher
The beautiful Abrolhos Islands off the coast of Western Australia are said to be one of the country's best kept secrets.
They are dotted with bright beach shacks that rock lobster fishermen and their families live in for three months of fishing.
There has been increasing concern that the islands are a secret no longer and too many visitors are wrecking the biodiversity.
But after studying the problem, university PhD student Emily Stoddard says there is still a place for tourists.
"I think that the islands certainly could handle much more day visitation of the type where the air charter flights bring in people for the day, take them for a swim and a snorkel, have a picnic, go for a walk," she said.

Grim outlook for grain production
The continuing drought has worsened Australia's outlook for grain production.
The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) has just downgraded its forecast for this season's crop yields, by 11 per cent, since its last forecast in February.
ABARE says the area being sown to wheat, barley and canola has also fallen 6 per cent.
But the bureau's John Hogan says while plantings are down in most states, the outlook is still better this winter than last.
"Last year we actually released our crop report a little bit earlier than this, and were a bit below what we're saying now," he said.

AWB in bid to stop inquiry accessing oil-for-food documents
Wheat exporter AWB is back in the Federal Court today, trying to stop the inquiry from using documents relating to the company's own investigation of the oil-for-food dealings.
AWB has asked the Federal Court to permanently block Commissioner Cole from accessing some 2,000 documents covered by legal professional privilege, including the company's own 18-month internal investigation into its part in the oil for food program.
Recent changes to the Royal Commissions Act now give Commissioner Cole the power to examine the documents, and decide if the privilege claim is valid.
Although the Federal Court is set to rule on the privilege status of the documents in July, today's action from AWB is to try to stop the Cole Inquiry accessing documents now.

Citrus canker report due out today
The Senate Rural Committee will table its report on central Queensland's citrus canker outbreak this afternoon.
The outbreak of the disease on Evergreen farm near Emerald led to the destruction of all citrus in the region - about 500,000 trees in all.

Demand keeps beef prices up
Global beef prices are tipped to remain solid, with strong demand for Australian beef and live cattle exports.
The US drought, and lacklustre US exports because of mad cow disease, should underpin this bouyant demand for several months, at least.
Steve Kay, the editor of US Cattle Buyers Weekly, says the American drought is slowing production, but the biggest single influence is still the inability of the US to export to Japan and Korea.

Wineries urged to dump excess wine
The country's peak wine grape grower organisation has called on wineries to dump excess wine to ease the current oversupply.
Mark Mckenzie, from Wine Grape Growers Australia, says wineries should help out growers by throwing out large volumes of old, poorer quality wine.
He says wineries should also consider mothballing their own vineyards and buying from individual growers instead.
"There are some wineries unfortunately who want to walk away from the issue and say it's not our problem, it's grower's problem. But they are still significant producers," he said.
"They are still part of a system and obviously they were very largely responsible for oversupply by giving very strong market signals over many years for growers to plant."
Meanwhile, the Australian table grape industry says it will continue its battle to try to export to China.
A delegation has spent the past fortnight meeting with quarantine officals and looking at the Chinese table grape market.
Australia has never had formal access to China but our fruit used to be sent via Hong Kong.
Australian Table Grape Association chief executive, Jeff Scott, says he will encourage the Federal Government to talk with Chinese Government officials.
"They are very concerned about some of Australia's pest and diseases in particular fruit fly but we've done a lot of work on fruit fly in the sense if we do cold disinfestation treatment it will kill all fruit fly," he said.

More wool processing goes offshore
The shipment of the Australian wool processing industry to Asia continues to gather pace.
Elders has announced it will start fitting out its new Chinese factory with equipment from its former Geelong plant in the next few weeks.
However, the company still has not made a decision on what it will do with equipment from its Parkes plant, in New South Wales.
Will McEwin, the general manager for Elders in China, says the former Geelong plant should be in full operation by early next year.
"It will be effectively what Geelong was, which was scouring as well as combing, right the way through to top and then we also have a link into the larger Nanchang group which is our partner in China and they go right the way through to suit making," he said.

Dairy farmers get animal welfare information kits
Dairy farmers around Australia are being sent kits in the mail, containing information about animal welfare practices.
The kit, from Australian Dairy Farmers Limited, aims to inform the wider community, rather than the farmers, about the industry's standards.
Wes Judd, from Australian Dairy Farmers, says it help dairy farmers stand up against critics in the community.
"We feel we have a huge resource in our producers around Australia and we want to give them the information," he said.

Banana prices has flow on effect
The high price of bananas has also pushed up the price of apples.
There is increased supermarket demand for apples after Cyclone Larry destroyed about 90 per cent Queensland banana crop.
Peter Darley, from Apple and Pear New South Wales, says prices are now the highest for several years, and in some places are up by 40 per cent on last year.
But he says there is also competition from mandarins.
"There is quite a steady demand for apples this year. Prices are reasonable. There is always going to be shelf space there as the bananas are quite expensive and they would be stocking very, very few bananas," he said.
"But I think also there is a preference to citrus as well. Children have got a preference for mandarins because they are easy to peel, whereas these days kids seem to want a sliced apple and that is very difficult to put in a lunchbox."

Insurance
Meanwhile, the banana industry wants to set up its own crop insurance scheme.
The industry on the east coast has not had any form of crop insurance for six years, after finance companies stopped offering it, due to weather risks.
The Australian Banana Growers Council says it has cost producers $60 million to get back on track after Cyclone Larry.
The council's Tony Heidrich says a cost-sharing insurance scheme between growers and the Federal Government would help.

Extention of ag census to small farms welcomed
The decision to include more of Australia's small farms in this year's agricultural census has been welcomed by authorities in coastal New South Wales.
Australian Bureau of Statistic's surveys are in the mail this week, including 30,000 to hobby farms that generate as little as $5,000 a year.
John Williams, from the New South Wales Primary Industries Department, says it will give the first truly accurate account of coastal farm production.

WA takes fight to 'cane toads with wings'
Western Australia is stepping up its fight against the destructive pest bird the starling.
The State Government has allocated an extra $2 million towards reducing starling populations in the state's south.
Agriculture Minister Kim Chance says starlings are every bit as unwelcome as the cane toads threatening the north of WA.
"I think cane toads with wings is a very apt description," he said.

Paper maker adds new zoo poo to roo poo
After having worldwide success with a paper made from kangaroo poo, a company in north-western Tasmania has signed up with Sydney's Taronga Zoo to make use of its elephant waste.
Creative Paper will make a range of stationary, for sale in the zoo's gift shop.
The company's Joanna Gair says the first elephant dung delivery was in a fine paper-making state by the time it arrived in the post.
"It had been in transit for just over a week so it was fairly ripe by the time that we'd received it," she said.

Senate committee changes criticised
The Federal Opposition says the Government's move to cut the number of Senate committees from 16 to 10 is partly designed to silence "maverick" rural MPs.
Labor and Greens senators say the Government wants to stop committees dealing with contentious rural issues like the AWB oil-for-food scandal, mismanagement at Australian Wool Innovation, citrus canker, the Snowy Hydro sale and Telstra services in the bush.
Liberal Senator Jeannie Ferris, from the Rural and Regional Affairs Committee, denies the changes will not stop scrutiny of rural issues.
"All those significant inquiries - AWB, AWI, any changes to the Wheat Marketing Act, the question of apples coming in from New Zealand - they have all been done by the Legislation Committee, which remains," she said.

No AWB bid for Indian wheat contract
Eight international companies are competing for the latest $2.2 million tonne tender of wheat to India, but Australia's AWB is not amongst them.
The wheat exporter is working through another two deals to India worth a million tonnes.
Canada and Europe are expected to be the main suppliers for the new tender.

Court ruling delays Cole inquiry findings
The Cole inquiry into wheat exporter AWB is now not expected to deliver its findings until September or October.
AWB's Federal Court action over privileged documents is the reason for the delay.
Although AWB lost its fight to keep the "apology" document confidential, it has kept fighting to keep some 2000 other documents from public scrutiny.
Earlier this month the wheat exporter launched legal action to get the Federal Court to decide the privilege status of the documents, including those of its own internal inquiry into oil-for-food dealings.
Yesterday's hearings in the Federal Court ruled AWB had the right to get the court to decide the legal status of the documents, because their case preceded the increased powers of Commissioner Cole.

China agrees iron ore price rise
China's steel mills have given into pressure to settle on a 19 per cent increase in iron ore price in negotiations with Australian producers.
Negotiations broke down in April, with China refusing to pay higher prices again, after hikes of more than 70 per cent last year.

Citrus canker report recommends AQIS changes
A Senate report into the Queensland citrus canker outbreak has recommended the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) respond to allegations of breaches of quarantine in fewer than three working days.
The five recommendations also included police training for some AQIS staff and an overhaul of the National Management Group for pest incursions.
The Senate rural and regional affairs committee found citrus canker had destroyed 500,000 trees around Emerald in Central Queensland, and cost the region $70 million.
Managing director of 2PH farms, John Pressler, lost more than 250,000 trees to canker, but says he is not surprised no-one was charged over the outbreak.
"It's really only subsequent to the Senate inquiry that the investigators actually revisited the whole scene," he said.
"By this time, a whole lot of evidence and information is missing, so it's not surprising, it's just another indictment against the way AQIS performed in this entire charade."
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says he will carefully consider the findings of the Senate report, and believes at least two of the recommendations make good sense.
He has defended AQIS against criticism that it was too slow to investigate reports of illegal imports of citrus budwood.
"I don't agree with the criticisms of AQIS. These investigations were conducted professionally and thoroughly," he said.

Mining bursaries offered to WA students
The Federal Government has established a $500 mining careers bursary, to encourage students to take up careers in the mining industry.
The cash is on offer to 30 year 10 students who choose to take on the challenging maths and science subjects that are pre-requisites for entry into mining courses at Western Australian universities.
Eric Lindsay, from Curtin University's school of mines, says he hopes the students will eventually help ease Western Australia's labour shortage.

Meat industry concerned over skilled worker visa delay
The Australian Meat Industry Council will meet the Federal Immigration and Agriculture ministers this week to try to sort out problems with the skilled workers visa program.
Currently, the Immigration Department is not processing applications for skilled workers under the 457 visa program because of concerns some employers are breeching the visa conditions.
Australian Meat Industry Council chief executive, Kevin Cottrell, says delays in processing visa applications for overseas meat workers are creating a nightmare for the industry.

Endangered cockatoo could scuttle pulp mill
Developers of a proposed $650 million pulp mill at Penola in South Australia fear six dead trees will scuttle their project.
The river red gums are potential breeding sites for the endangered red-tailed black cockatoo.
The Federal Department of Environment and Heritage has declared the project will have a significant impact on the bird, and referred the matter to the Minister, Ian Campbell, for a final decision.
Project manager John Roche says his Protavia company is very disappointed with the decision.

Qld Uniting Church leader speaks out against proposed dam
A religious leader has spoken out against a proposed dam on south-east Queensland's Mary River.
Up to 900 properties along the Mary River will be flooded, forcing many farmers and home-owners off their land.
The Queensland Government says drilling has found bedrock, meaning the site is suitable for a dam.
The Moderator of the Uniting Church in Queensland, Dr David Pittman, says the local community was not consulted before the project was announced.
"The people in the Mary Valley at the present time are experiencing a mix of dismay, of shock, of confusion and of anger," he said.

Blue mussel farm set to become Australia's largest
Within five years, South Australia's Wallaroo Blue mussel farm will be the largest in the country.
The business is spending $4.5 million developing its 200 hectare lease in the Spencer Gulf.
New Zealand company Flinders Seafood aims to supply 2,000 tonnes a year of blue mussels to the fresh seafood market.
Company director Bruce Koller says a major part of the expansion will be marketing mussels to Australian consumers.
"In New Zealand we eat about two and a quarter kilograms of mussels per head per year and in Australia it's about one tenth of that," he said.

Mango industry to target young families
Research has revealed mango lovers are an ageing population, with more than 60 per cent of consumers aged over 40.
The expanding mango industry plans to step up its campaign to target young families, particularly in the cooler southern climates.
Trevor Dunmore from the Australian Mango Industry Association says young people need to be taught how to eat mangoes easily.
"Young people are often busy like all of us and often don't have time and want something quick and fast, and that's why you see fast food restaurants become so popular," he said.
"Traditionally mangoes have been seen as messy to eat, something you had to actually cut and prepare and it takes time.

Garden club members take up fruit fly fight
Gardeners near Victoria's Goulburn Valley region are taking up the fight against Queensland fruit fly.
Recent outbreaks in southern New South Wales and Shepparton in Victoria have spurred the Garden Club at Howlong, on the Murray River, into coordinating baiting programs, and disposing of rotten fruit.
Howlong Garden Club members say they are extremely disappointed with this year's crop.
"We had a nectarine tree this year that was just beautiful and I thought I'll get in before these little buggers and I'll pick them a bit earlier," one member said.
"I picked them all, took them inside and cut one and it was just full of maggots, it was just terrible."

Anti-mulesing campaigners protest at soccer World Cup
Animal rights protesters have taken their campaign against mulesing Australian sheep to the soccer World Cup in Germany.

Vegie exports drop
Vegetable exports dropped $30 million in the last ten months, as Asian markets overlooked fresh Australian produce in favour of cheaper goods.
At the same time, imports of fresh and frozen vegies increased by 6 per cent, particularly frozen potatoes from the Netherlands and Belgium.
Chief economist at Ausveg, Ian James, says the big threat to Australian exports is from China.
"The Chinese threat is more one in terms of them competing with Australia in traditional Asian markets, rather than Chinese imports, if you like, coming into Australia," he said.

Volunteers pitch in to help out bushfire-affected farmers
A massive working bee is under way in southern New South Wales to help farmers burnt out on New Year's Day.
The bushfire blackened 25,000 hectares of farming country near Junee.
People from all walks of life have pitched in to repair the damage.
The fire destroyed 1,500 kilometres of fencing and six months on much of that still needs to be replaced.
There has been no substantial rain and for many farmers hand feeding livestock is the priority.
So armed with gloves, pliers and wire-strainers, more than 100 volunteers are lending a hand.

WA Govt looks to Europe to toughen illegal fishing laws
The Western Australian Government has looked to leads from Europe for tough new laws on illegal fishing.
Fisheries Minister Jon Ford says those caught in state waters will now face fines of up to $150,000 and longer jail sentences.
The changes also give state fisheries officers new powers to seize suspected illegal vessels, even if they do not have an actual catch on board.
Mr Ford says international fishing laws do not have enough clout.
"I sent my officers over to Europe to talk to the OECD authorities that deal with illegal fishing," he said.
"They told us it was very difficult to get a conviction under international law, it was unlikely that it would change in the near future. Our best chance was to strengthen our laws at a domestic level."

Frost hits SA winter potato crop
The price of potatoes could be set to rise after a large area of the winter crop was wiped out in South Australia's Mallee region.
Growers estimate about 10,000 tonnes of potatoes have been affected by frost and they are expecting stocks to be in short supply later in the year.
Pinnaroo grower Rick Rossitano lost about 4,000 tonnes.
"It's very widespread. It's affected all the spud farmers in the area," he said.

Dairy farmers warned to prepare for drop in income
There is a warning for dairy farmers today to prepare for a drop in income, as milk processing companies announce new season prices.
Fonterra has announced a 5 per cent drop in opening price compared to last season, blaming the downturn on a weaker international market and fluctuating Aussie dollar.
Industry analyst Steve Spencer believes other processors will follow suit.
"There's a lot of competition for milk in the industry and that's a pressure that's keeping prices reasonably firm," he said.

Police won't investigate mulesing complaints
The New South Wales Police Force has poured cold on water on claims that farmers could face animal cruelty charges if they mules sheep without pain relief.
Animal Liberation has warned that from July 1, they will ask police to investigate anyone carrying out a mulesing operation without analgesia, saying that would contravene animal cruelty legislation.
But NSW Assistant Police Commissioner Steve Bradshaw says police will not be visiting farms, as mulesing is legal.

ABARE urged to lower wheat yield estimates
A grains industry analyst says the latest forecasts for Australia's crop yields this year are too optimistic.
The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) has revised its harvest estimates down by 11 per cent since February but says the outlook is still quite positive.
But the editor of the Callum Downs Commodity News, Malcolm Bartholomeus, says ABARE should lower its wheat yield estimate of 22.8 million tonnes.
"If we don't get some rain right around the country very soon they will have to start factoring in some quite substantial production shortfalls from the estimate that they have published at this stage," he said.

Joyce not budging on biofuels bill
Nationals Senator Barnaby Joyce says he will vote against the Federal Government to force changes to a fuel tax bill, which could see farmers get fewer rebates on biodiesel.
He says the bill, being debated today, only allows farmers to get a diesel fuel rebate from major oil companies, and not small biodiesel producers.

N Korea nuclear concerns push up gold price
The price of gold was up $12 in New York overnight after a spate of safety-net buying by international investors concerned about North Korea's nuclear ambitions.
Gold Corporation analyst Brom Suchecki says safe-haven buying is also rapidly increasing in Australia, as a protection against nervy equities and booming real estate markets.
Mr Suchecki says gold buying at the Perth Mint is up 300 per cent in the past year.
"A lot of it is what you would call your mum and dad investors. I think that institutional demand is probably a factor overseas, probably not so much in Australia," he said.

Tas mine fire halts production
An overnight fire has stopped production at an iron ore mine in a remote area of north-east Tasmania.
The fire at the Savage River mine is believed to have started in an ore concentrator while workers were welding.
More than 40 firefighters battled the blaze, and Australian Bulk Minerals managing director, Dave Sandy, says the damage is still being assessed.
"Most of the damage is related to conveyor belts and electrical cabling, there may be some structural damage on the upper levels but on the main floor it seems to be in reasonably good shape," he said.

Truss comments spark rail infrastructure stoush
A war of words has broken out about whether the rail freight industry is pulling its weight when it comes to funding infrastructure around the country.
Federal Transport Minister, Warren Truss, said rail should do more to make itself competitive and win back its share of the market from road freight.
The Productivity Commission is investigating whether road and rail freight industries are competing on a level playing field.
Brian Nye from the Australasian Railways Association says the industry is working hard to improve its position.
"Rail has been neglected and the Commonwealth Government has put quite a lot of money into it, but overall it's doing a lot to improve itself and it could do more," he said.

US could target Aust pork market, researcher says
The re-entry of the US into the Japanese beef market could see American producers try to sell more pork to Australia.
The chief executive of the Pork Cooperative Research Council, Dr Roger Campbell, said the beef ban saw the Japanese switch to US pork.
"So what they did get was pick up [in]... exports, record exports actually, in pork, so they are likely to come back and so they'll be looking for other outlets for them and Australia is one of those outlets," he said.

US cattlemen unhappy with Japanese beef trade terms
The US beef industry is not impressed by Japan's agreement to re-open its market to US beef after Tokyo completes inspections of US plants in July.
Trade adviser for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, Greg Doud, complains it has been two-and-a-half years and the US has traded no beef with Japan.
Now on the eve of a visit to the US by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, Japan has agreed to resume imports, but keep out the vast majority of US beef with what Mr Doud says is an unscientific barrier to trade.
"We're not going to be happy until we're at an international guideline, and we're able to trade everything, at a minimum, under 30 months of age," he said.
Japan insists on a 20-month standard to combat mad cow disease.
The US cattlemen back trade sanctions against Japan, introduced by several US lawmakers, until Japan finally lifts its US beef ban.
The Cattle Council of Australia is cautiously welcoming the news.
Executive director David Innal says the sooner consumer confidence about the safety of beef returns, the better for all cattle producers.
"We welcome the US beef coming back into the market," he said.
"Since BSE was detected total consumption of beef is down about 15 per cent and what we are about is seeing that total pie growing of beef consumption.

New 'Team Dogging' event to feature in rodeo
This weekend's annual rodeo in the small far north Queensland town of Laura features a new event called 'Team Dogging'.
Organisers believe it is the first rodeo in Australia to have a bull-dogging competition with two horsemen leaping off to grab a bullock - one by the head, the other by the tail.
Laura rodeo secretary Karlene Shephard says the event evolved last year when the truckload of normal dogging steers did not turn up, so they used larger bullocks instead.
"[The] fellas went through and drafted off the ones that had a little bit of horn that was there and put them in the dogging box," she said.
"When the first fella went in he looked at it and he said 'gee they're a bit big' because they were bullocks and they were flat out fitting in the dogging box and anyway another fella off the committee said 'why don't two of you have a go at it'.

Salvos to maintain refuge staffing levels
The Australian Services Union says the Salvation Army has agreed to maintain staffing levels at its Newcastle refuge for the time being, while negotiations continue over planned staff cuts.
The Salvos want to restructure Faith Cottage, a crisis accommodation centre for women and children, so permanent staff would be employed on a part-time basis.
A night-shift position will also be cut.
The union's Kylie Rooke says management of the centre has agreed to negotiate its position.
"The Salvation Army have responded to our offer of working cooperatively together by saying they are willing to continue discussions and they will maintain the status quo at the service in regards to it being staffed 24 hours and the hours that the staff work," she said.

Fuel tax Bill expected to negatively impact on biofuels industry
A fuel tax Bill which passed through the Senate last night is expected to have a negative effect on the biofuels industry in Australia by removing tax advantages for smaller biofuels producers.
Last year the Federal Government commissioned a report into the viability of the industry, including research from the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE).
ABARE'S study says the world oil price, feed grain prices and tax arrangements all affect the industry.
The report's author, Graham Love, says any changes to taxation are significant.
"They could have a significant effect to the extent that if tax treatment became more generous then you would presume that that would make the industry more viable or if they were to go the other way it would be less viable," he said.
The Senate was also told the Bill could severely disadvantage rural communities who are looking to the biofuels industry for investment.
Gary Tepper, from Swan Hill Council in Victoria, says the whole community is working hard to make sure a local ethanol plant goes ahead.
"We really see the whole biofuels, renewable energy industry as some sort of hope for regions," he said.

Bad roads costing states: report
A new report claims low road and transport investment is costing some states up to 12 per cent in livestock exports.
The Australian Livestock Transporters Association is debating the report on bad roads at its national conference this weekend in Canberra.
While fuel prices continue to plague the industry, the association's executive director, Luke Fraser, says gains can be also made in other areas.
"There's a limit to what the industry and perhaps even the Australian Government can do with world fuel prices, which has forced us to look more closely at things like targeted road investment," he said.

Farmers, service station owners not expecting inquiry to lower petrol prices
The National Farmers Federation and fuel station owners are not expecting another Senate inquiry into fuel will lower prices.
Senator Nick Minchin has announced the new inquiry after pressure from the Federal Opposition.
While there is scepticism about what the Government says is the 45th parliamentary probe into petrol pricing, Ron Bowden from the Service Stations Association says it is always a useful exercise.
"There's always value to an inquiry because the market never stays still," Mr Bowden said.

Fishing cops to be based in Darwin
The policing of illegal fishing in Australian waters is being centralised in Darwin.
It is part of the Federal Government's budget allocation of $389 million over the next three years.
Fifty-three people will be based at the new Territory head office of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority.
The authority's Peter Venslovas says nearly 190 illegal boats have been apprehended so far this year.
"And our target rate for the coming year will be about 650 vessels," he said.
"Last calender year 281 illegal foreign fishing vessels were apprehended. Most of those, or nearly all of those were from Indonesia.

Use of brown coal could reduce greenhouse emissions, study shows
A research project into the use of brown or dirty coal could reduce Australia's greenhouse emissions from power generation to close to zero in the next decade.
The Monash Energy and Anglo Coal project in Victoria is exploring the feasibility of drying, gasifying and then liquefying coal into a new synthetic low emission fuel.
With 80 per cent of Australia's power generation coming from coal, Jeff Cochrane from Monash Energy says there will be important benefits for the environment

Strategy tackles vegie supply plan for remote communities
Aboriginal communities should get better supplies of fresh fruit and vegetables, following the remote Indigenous stores conference held in Adelaide this week.
Community leaders, store managers and freight companies, from three states and the Northern Territory, collaborated to work out better ways to improve delivery of perishable goods.
Many neighbouring communities have been using different trucking companies and in far north WA, Bililuna store manager Tom Waller says hopefully they can now get their vegies more than once a fortnight.

Organic beef producers feeling drought
Organic cattle producers in the outback channel country of Queensland and South Australia are finding it hard to meet demand because of the continuing drought.
OBE Beef, which supplies grass-fed organic beef to the United States, Europe and Asia, is finding it tough as dry conditions keep cattle numbers low.
Sharon Oldfield from Cowarie Station on the Birdsville Track, who supplies organic beef, says they have had to halve their cattle herd.
"We wouldn't have had a good general summer rain probably for four or five years now, in some areas it's been up to six years," she said.

Wool trade features in award-winning novel
A former wool grower and shearer's cook has won Australia's richest literary prize.
Roger McDonald was last night awarded the Miles Franklin award for his novel about the origins of Australia's wool trade, The Ballad of Desmond Kale.

NT aerial medial team celebrates milestone
There is another medical team celebrating 60 years in the air.
The Top End Aerial Medical Service averages six flights a day, caring for those living north of Elliott in the Northern Territory, and also serves offshore oil rigs and parts of South-East Asia.
Flight nurse Marg Fuller has been on board for half of the service's history, and has one particularly happy memory.

Europe poised to act on foreign wine threat
Europe is admitting it has to do something about the threat from foreign wines produced in Australia, South Africa and Chile.
The European Commission has unveiled plans to pull out more than 10 per cent of Europe's vines over the next five years to reduce its wine glut.
The move, which will cost of 2.4 billion euros, is an admission that Europe is worried about the threat from foreign wine producers like Australia, South Africa and Chile.
The EU also admits it has made mistakes in the areas of marketing and subsidies.
The commission's Michael Mann says it is a radical overhaul to address a massive wine lake.
"We are going to get rid of a situation where we have got too much wine. We are going to use money to get people out," he said.
"We are going to simplify our labelling rules and you know after a five-year period once all is said and done with the re-structuring it will be the market that decides. We want to be in the situation where the European wines are the ones people are choosing."

Wheat trade with Iraq to continue: Howard
Wheat Australia, which is yet to ship 350,000 tonnes of wheat to Iraq, is watching events in the Middle East closely, after the Iraqi Trade Minister threatened to stop all deals between the two countries.
Abdul Falah al-Sudany threatened to cut trade ties after the shooting of a bodyguard from his ministry by Australian soldiers earlier this week.
But following diplomatic talks overnight, Prime Minister John Howard has told Channel Nine he does not expect Australia's wheat trade to be affected.
"I can tell you that the Iraqi Trade Minister saw the Australian ambassador and the Iraqi Trade Minister told our ambassador that he did not want this incident to interfere with the bilateral relationship or to affect our trade relationship," he said.
Meanwhile, the Western Australian Farmers Federation denies it is withdrawing support for AWB's wheat export monopoly.
Federation senior vice-president, Robert Doney, yesterday suggested in a national newspaper interview that the veto power should be removed from AWB's single desk.
But grains president Ray Marshall has described the comments as a "naive indiscretion", and denies any split on the issue.
"Always when you have 17 people sitting around a table you will have differing opinions," he said.
"I believe at this moment whilst policy is very clear, we're at the status quo until such time that the Cole Inquiry comes out and we're very clear about our views.
Meanwhile, Australia is not alone in suffering wheat crop losses this year from drought.
The US crop continues to decline in quality, as well as quantity, amid persistent heat and drought.
The US wheat crop is already forecast off 14 per cent from the last marketing year, and dry conditions are also taking a toll on the quality of what's left.
Brad Rippey is a US Agriculture Department meteorologist and says the winter wheat crop is rated 29 per cent which is good to excellent.
"But a very large 46 per cent is very poor to poor," he said.

Minister pushes deal with Gulf states
Although talks to set up a free trade deal with the United Arab Emirates have stalled, Trade Minister Mark Vaile says Australia should try to do a deal with all six nations of the Gulf Co-operation Council.
A spokesperson for the Minister says the Gulf states are an important and growing market for Australia, with exports of goods worth $4 billion in 2005.
The Gulf Council comprises the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

Commodity exports' earnings booming
Earnings from commodity exports are booming even more than expected this year, largely thanks to the minerals and energy sector, according to the latest figures.
Australia's Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) predicts commodity exports will rise 16 per cent this year, more than double its original forecast issued at the Outlook Conference in February.
The increase is thanks to a strong minerals and energy sector which is now expected to earn $48 billion - up $4 billion on the February forecast.
It is a different story for farm commodities though with the February forecast of $29.6 billion downgraded slightly.

NLIS program chief defends rollout
The head of the committee in charge of implementing the National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) has defended the time it is taking to roll it out.
That is despite just one state so far - Victoria - having mandatory NLIS without any exemptions.
The NLIS is a national program designed to allow all cattle to be traced from paddock to plate.
The chairman of the national NLIS executive committee, John Wilde, says the rollout has exceeded expectations.
"We are well into the implementation phase and it's performing really well, it's exceeding our expectations. It will obviously be a number of years before the implementation phase is finally washed through. But we are very very pleased with the progress to date," he said.
Meanwhile, Linda Hewitt, the chairwoman of the Australian Beef Association, which is lobbying against the NLIS, says cattlemen were better off without the scheme.

Tas fox population confirmed: report
A new report has found there are definitely foxes in Tasmania and they pose a multi-million dollar threat to the State's agricultural sector.
Despite a number of reported sightings since a state task force was set up three years ago, the existence of foxes in Tasmania has remained an open question.
But main author of the new report, Glenn Saunders, says there is no doubt that a small population exists.
"I guess we came in as an external group and looked at it impartially," he said.
"We had nothing to gain or benefit from concluding one way or the other, but on reviewing all of the available evidence that we could gather, and I mean all of the available evidence not just snippets of it here and there, we really couldn't come to any other conclusion."
And if they find the Tassie foxes, there is a market for them.
A fox skin buyer and exporter says demand and prices for Australian fox skins are rising after years of disinterest from the trade.
The trade declined and prices plummeted during the 1980s during a bitter campaign waged by animal liberation groups against the use of fur in fashion.
A large number of fox shooters stopped taking skins and the skill of skinning, and preparing the pelts, almost died out.
But fox skin exporter Don McGilvray says renewed Chinese interest in fur is leading the trade's recovery.
"I'm paying from $25 for the tops and the averages are anywhere from 13 to $16," he said.

Fishing industries set for restructure
Fishing industries in four regions across Australia look set for major change as a result of a Federal Government buy-back.
The $220 million scheme closed last week and unofficial reports from industry sources suggest that up to half the fishermen in some areas have accepted the Government's offer.
In New South Wales, the South-East Trawl Fishing Industry Association president, Fritz Drenkharn, says eight out of 14 boats have put in tenders and if they are all accepted it will have a big impact on processing plants.
"Oh well, restructuring on the shore facilities, the haulage contractors will also be sitting on the fence waiting to see what's happening in relation to their business, Mr Drenkharn said.
"In the on-shore facilities there's a real lot riding on the line."
Meanwhile, there should be more prawns for Christmas this year, with news that 660,000 baby tiger prawns have survived a cold spell in the far north of Western Australia.
The Kimberley Prawn Company was concerned their post-larval stock had died a fortnight ago, when water temperatures dropped in the tank.
Owner Ian Crimp says it now proves the region is suitable to harvest throughout the year.
"[It] now means that we have the ability of cropping all year round at Derby, whereas parts of Australia they can only crop prawns during the summertime," Mr Crimp said.

Grain farmers' future looks bleak
Many Victorian grain farmers are still very depressed about the outlook for the season.
In western Victoria, the local water authority, Grampians Wimmera Mallee Water, says the winter channel run may even have to be cancelled for rural home dams because they are only 6 per cent full, the lowest level ever recorded for this time of year.
Grain and sheep farmer Bernard Gross from Drung Drung says if winter rainfall does not return to normal, the future will be bleak.
"My family have been here since 1873. But I have been told that the early 1900s were also particularly dry," Mr Gross said.

Frost-tolerant crops a possibility: scientists
Scientists believe grain growers could one day be able to sow frost-tolerant cereal crops.
The Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics in Adelaide is studying the genes of Japanese barley, which has frost-tolerant properties.
Frost damage is believed to cost South Australia's and Victoria's barley industries more than $30 million per year.
Professor Geoff Fincher says this research could eventually have applications for other crops.

Dried mangoes head to E Timor orphanages
Children in orphanages across the capital of East Timor will be chewing on Northern Territory 'mango leathers' this month.
Kakadu Dried Fruits, based at Batchelor, has donated 500 packets of dried mango.
Owner Doug Allsopp says he has more to offer as food aid, if the first batch is well received.
"We had an excess of this product [and] because our product doesn't contain any preservatives or additives, it doesn't have an indefinite shelf life," he said.
"Rather than allow the product to go to waste we thought that people in East Timor could probably put it to good use.

Swimmers avoid crocs in lake record attempt
Six Sydneysiders swam into the record books over the weekend, crossing Australia's largest man made lake in Western Australia's Kimberley region.
Their efforts crossing Lake Argyle raised $80,000 for the Royal Flying Doctor Service.
Swimmer Jon Attwater, from Balmoral, says it took them 19 hours over three days and thankfully they did not spot a crocodile through their goggles.
"We didn't have any face-to-face confrontations which we were very glad of, Mr Attwater said.
"We do a lot of ocean swimming and we swim around in the sea with probably a lot more sharks than we're ever likely to see crocodiles here, but we were very concerned about meeting up with a crocodile, we've only seen pictures of them in movies and they don't look very nice."

Harnessing up the horse and cart increases in popularity
As the price of fuel rises, many people are turning to alternative modes of transport.
They are dusting off their bicycles, putting on the sneakers, but what about harnessing up the horse and cart?
A group of carriage drivers in Tasmania gets together once a month and it seems interest in their hobby is on the rise.
Driver Wally McGlone says some members of the group have been braving the traffic and taking to the bitumen.
"We've got one man here and he's driven his horse down to what they call the railway supermarket at Ulverstone and got his groceries, but I don't think his wife was game enough to go with him but he went down anyhow," Mr McGlone said.

Council continues fight for skilled worker visas
The meat processing sector says it has not given up fighting for more skilled worker visas to be processed, despite failing to get a commitment from the Federal Government.
Abattoirs across Australia employ hundreds of foreign workers under the 457 visa program to address labour shortages, but over the past four months the Immigration Department has delayed some applications.
The Australian Meat Industry Council will continue meetings with the Federal Government this week.
The council's Kevin Cottrill says talks so far have addressed allegations that industry is misusing the program:
"There are a lot of allegations and a lot of them are not specifically related to the meat industry, and I think this is one of the difficulties we have at the moment," he said.
"Our discussions with the department generally have been around issues of skill levels that are required. There have been some discussions about pay levels but these issues are really now covered by pay regulations."

AWB finalises deal with India
Wheat exporter AWB has finalised two deals to India, worth 1 million tonnes, after many months of negotiations.
The first shipment was held up after claims of contamination by Indian authorities which were later disproved by further testing.
The second deal, though reached in principle some time ago, has only now been finalised.
AWB spokesman Peter McBride says the wheat will be shipped as soon as possible, but farmers will bear the cost of the delays.

Forecast brings more heartache to farmers
There is another gloomy weather forecast for farmers who had been hoping for rain.
The latest climate forecast shows that the vast majority of Australia is likely to receive less than average rainfall over the next three months, with the driest outlook of all in the grainbelt of Western Australia.
And in another blow to grain growers, temperatures are likely to be above average, particularly in New South Wales and southern Queensland.
Dr Andrew Watkins, from the National Climate Centre, says warm sea temperatures in the Pacific are to blame.

NFF announces meeting to resolve quarantine differences
The National Farmers Federation (NFF) says there is a lack of confidence in Australia's quarantine system and it has set up a meeting on July 14 to try resolve differences between farmers and government.
The NFF says farmers and industry have a number of concerns with the way Australia's quarantine system is working and say that communication between authorities, and the farm sector, has broken down.
The July meeting will bring together industry and the Federal Government to try and sort out the problems, including what the NFF calls a "loss of confidence" in quarantine and biosecurity.
But Kevin Cooper, from the NSW Department of Primary Industries, denies the system is in trouble.
"Experiences in recent years has shown that the communication has been robust and sound," he said.

Milk processor explores merger option
One of Australia's largest milk processors has opened the door to a possible merger.
Victorian-based Tatura Milk, which provides about 5 per cent of Australia's dairy products, is undertaking a financial review after posting a $6 million loss before tax last year.
Chairman Ian Bertram says all opportunities will be explored during the six-month review.
"We haven't ruled out any possibilities, we've left it very open, we don't know the outcome, we don't know the answer," he said.

Sheep farmer helps out cyclone victims
A Victorian sheep farmer has started a charity drive to help Queensland banana growers whose crops were devastated by cyclone Larry.

Federation dismisses survey perceptions
Most consumers think the chicken industry is using hormones and steroids to make their birds artificially large, according to a survey which the industry funded.
The Australia Chicken Meat Federation says the perceptions revealed in its survey are untrue.
Executive director Dr Andreas Dubs says antibiotics are used to keep birds healthy, but it is good breeding and not additives that has caused the increase in size.
"They were essentially thinking primarily of hormones and antibiotics, that's what came up," Dr Dubs said.

Frost wipes out crops in WA
Horticulturalists in Western Australia are suffering an unseasonal frost, wiping out a number of fruit and vegetable producers in the state's south east.
The estimated $4 million worth of damage will cause shortages and price rises.
Manjimup avocado producer Tony Fontiani says it is his second successive year of seasonal setbacks.
"We've lost about approximately 90 per cent of our fruit we had 12,000 trays of avocados on the trees and I think we'll be lucky if we pick a thousand to 1,500 trays," he said.
"It just means that we will have to tighten our belts and spend less and struggle through for another year but we're only just getting in to the situation where we're producing a quantity of avocados, this was going to be our big year."
And frost could cut Australia's navel orange crop this season by 20 per cent, according to preliminary forecasts.

SAFF rejoins National Farmers Federation
South Australia's Farmers Federation (SAFF) is rejoining the national farming body.
SAFF withdrew its membership from the National Farmers Federation (NFF) three years ago because it could not afford the fees.
The NFF has negotiated a discounted rate to South Australia for the next two years.
SAFF's Carol Vincent says her organisation could not continue being independent from the national body.
"I don't think it was affordable for the SAFF any more not to be a be a member of the NFF. Farming organisations can't afford for the future to be in competition with one another they have to be working together, we think the future needs strong national representation as well as strong state representation," she said.
NFF chief executive Ben Fargher says the move will strengthen farmers' influence in Canberra.
"To be frank it does hurt NFF's credibility if state farm organisations are not members, so it is great that SAFF is coming back," he said.

Burning boat sends strong message to illegal fishers
An Indonesian fishing boat is being burnt in Darwin today - the 74th to be apprehended in Australian waters this year.
Earlier this year, the Navy seized the 'Harapan', which is an Indonesian type three ice boat, inside the Australian fishing zone boundary.
The 27 metre long boat could store up to 40 tonnes of fish, but this one was only carrying about 50 kilograms of fish such as snapper aided by GPS navigation.
The Australian Fisheries Management Authority says these boat burnings send a strong message to the owners in Indonesia, that illegal fishing will not be tolerated.
It has been set alight in a boat burn pit at Hudson Creek, near the busy East Arm Port of Darwin and will take all day to burn completely. Any metal remaining will be salvaged for cost recovery.

Gold mining company goes into administration
One of Western Australia's historic gold companies, Croesus Mining, has slipped into administration, despite record gold prices.
Hartley's mining expert Rob Brierley says it is disappointing for the many small shareholders in the Kalgoorlie-based Croesus and he is not sure whether the company will survive the overhaul from the administrators.
"It's a bit sad really, 80 years of continous operations at Norseman, they'll to continue to operate the mine, but obviously the company is going to be under financial duress," he said.
Meanwhile, a social divide is becoming evident in central Queensland where the coal mining boom is turning to gloom for many towns.
Attractive wages at Bowen Basin coal mines have enticed thousands of people from around Australia, pushing rental prices in small rural towns to Sydney and Melbourne levels.
Marion Callow, from Clermont's Commercial Hotel, says a basic wage will not cover the rent any more.
"The contractors are coming into towns to work for the mines and then the mines themselves are providing the cheap accommodation for their workers," she said.

Fox control program extended
The Tasmanian Government has extended its fox control program for another four years.
The move comes after an independent report found foxes do exist in Tasmania and immediate controls are needed.

Dingo wee proves successful in scaring off kangaroos
Perth-based researchers have stumbled on a successful, although unusual, way to frighten kangaroos - dingo wee.
A team from Curtin University believes kangaroos recognise the smell of their long-time predator, the dingo and steer clear.
They hope to isolate the chemical, to create a product that keeps roos away from crops.
Project manager Dr Michael Parsons says they first trialled the smell at a wildlife sanctuary and watched the kangaroos flee.
"She walked out of the bathroom with a tube of urine in an evaporative canister and as soon as she got about five metres from them, they looked at her and immediately fled ... and this was a whole mob of them," he said.

Wild pigs may be spreading sugar cane disease, says farmer
Sugar cane smut has now been confirmed on more than 20 farms in south-east Queensland.
The fungal disease was discovered for the first time in Queensland two weeks ago and the industry's exotic disease plant health plan is in force.
While there are now strict quarantine measures on the movement of people and plants, cane farmer Bruce Royan says wild pigs may be spreading the disease.
"It's obviously blown in with the wind or somebody else has been driving around the farm," he said.

Report highlights desire for change to wheat marketing
A new report on the future of wheat exports from Australia has backed calls for changes to the single desk.
Single Vision Grains Australia, a government-funded body, surveyed 27 industry groups from growers to exporters and grain marketers.
Its conclusions mirror other reports about the future of wheat marketing - most want to keep the single desk, but remove AWB's right to veto exports from other traders and bolster the powers of the Wheat Export Authority.
But the Grains Council, which represents around 30,000 growers, says Single Vision should not have carried out the survey in the first place.
Chairman Murray Jones says the council refused to take part when approached.
"For them to say that they're the peak body for the Australian grains industry is absolutely incorrect," Mr Jones said.
"Their press release comes out saying the Australian grains industry's calling for changes to single desk policy, now who's calling for it, are they calling for it?" he said.

Farm lobby group concerned over biosecurity laws
The New South Wales Farmers Association says it has found three major flaws with Australia's biosecurity legislation.
The farm body commissioned barrister Tom Brennan to identify which laws might be legally challenged, amid concern that communication between farmers and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has broken down.
Chairman of the association's quarantine committee, Peter Carter, says Mr Brennan's advice has raised a number of concerns.
"The first one is that the import risk analysis has no legal status, which is quite frightening and can be ignored by AQIS," Mr Carter said.
"Secondly, he found that there needs to be better definition of the way that the minister consults with AQIS, or doesn't consult with them, but it needs to be defined in law because at the moment there is a big hole in the law over that."

Hendra virus horse death concerns vets association
The Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) says it is concerned about the handling of the death of a horse in Queensland two weeks ago from the hendra virus.
The virus killed horse trainer Vic Rail and 17 of his horses in the mid 1990s.

McGauran backs livestock ID system
The Federal Agriculture Minister, Peter McGauran, has defended an audit of the National Livestock Identification System.
The Australian Beef Association (ABA) says the audit ordered by Mr McGauran in recent weeks, will not be independent, and will not solve problems inherent in the livestock traceback system.
ABA chair Linda Hewitt says there is no point checking the database is working, if the accuracy of information entered at the property and meatworks level is not checked.
Mr McGauran says the audit will be both independent and comprehensive.
"I can only say that this will be an independent assessment by the government of the day. The ABA is quite intemperate. They claim the NLIS is fundamentally flawed, not just the database," Mr McGauran said.

Drought forcing cattle evacuations from Channel Country
One of the nation's largest beef producers says it is moving nearly 1,000 head of cattle out of Queensland's drought-stricken Channel Country every week.
S. Kidman and Co produces beef for markets in Japan, the US and South-East Asia on properties on the Georgina and Diamantina Rivers and Cooper Creek.
Chief executive Greg Campbell says a moderate flood earlier this year was not enough to stop destocking.
"Throughout the Channel Country at the moment we're about 50 to 60 per cent stocked," he said.

Rain brings relief to WA farmers
There has finally been some rain relief in Western Australia, with falls along the western coast overnight.
Only marginal falls were recorded inland, with some grain growers faring better than others.
"By 6:00pm last night I'd had 20.2 millimetres and then overnight another 7.5mls, so for those few hours it was 27.7 and it's absolutely fantastic," John Williams from Bindoon said.
"Just so great to see all this rain after all this time. Those that have been waiting for the rain will be able to put their crops in and those that have dry sown, this will help them along just great."
Garth Cowald from West Canna says he had 4.5 millimetres of rain last night.
"We haven't sown any wheat yet, getting a bit late now, the ground is too dry. We haven't had hardly any rain now for three months. We have sown lupins and oats but it hasn't come up," Mr Cowald said.
"So with the costs now days, I think it's better to leave the seed and fertiliser in the shed and the chemicals and just take it from there."

Low demand reduces NT pig market
Contract pig shooters in the Northern Territory are selling off their hunting dogs because they do not have an export market this year.
More than 20 registered shooters around the town of Katherine cull hundreds of feral pigs during the dry season and ship the meat to Germany.
But this year demand and prices are so low, not a single pig will be going overseas.
Hunter Athol Schmidt says it is bad news for the environment, because without an export market it is too expensive to hunt.
"At the moment the stuff that's coming out of Queensland and northern NSW is just filling the pet food market," Mr Schmidt said.
"The prices down south they opened up at 60 cents per kilo, they tell me they've gone to 80 but you're still flogging a dead horse.

Commissioner to investigate bushfire practices
Concerns about bushfire prevention and recovery measures in Victoria will be investigated by the state's emergency services commissioner.
Commissioner Bruce Esplin has been meeting with farmers and other groups, who believe not enough fuel reduction burns were done before the Grampians bushfires in January.
Mr Esplin says the report will assess what progress has been made since his report on the 2003 Alpine fires.
"I made a lot of recommendations in that report, 148 recommendations in fact, and I think it's time that we put out a report to the community about what's happened, what's the progress on each of those recommendations, " Mr Esplin said.

Timbercorp branches out to compete with NZ imports
Agribusiness company Timbercorp is diversifying into the tomato business, in a bid to compete with imports.
It is to spend $25 million building Australia's biggest truss tomato glasshouse at Two Wells, north of Adelaide.
Chief executive Robert Hance says it will produce 5,000 tonnes of tomatoes for the domestic market, the same amount that is imported from New Zealand each year.

Qld farmers highlighting green thumbs
Queensland grain growers are introducing a set of environmental guidelines to show off their 'green' credentials.
Lobby group Agforce is collating a best management practice manual in the Fitzroy Basin, in central Queensland, with plans to roll it out across the nation.
Spokesman Kym Bremner says they want to prove to the Government and urban Australians that they are being pro-active and addressing problems.
"The uptake of zero till, while it's been fairly spectacular, is still something that people need to work on," Mr Bremner said

Egg industry seeks to boost sales
The egg industry has launched a push to get more people eating eggs, after figures show Australia has the lowest rate of consumption of eggs in the western world.
On average we eat 169 eggs each per year, a long way below the Japanese, who eat 350, or the Americans, who consume 260 eggs each.
James Kellaway from the Australian Egg Corporation also says that while Australians are offered a wider choice of eggs, most are buying cage industry products.
"Just over 80 per cent of Australia's production is represented in caged eggs and that has a price point attached to it which is relatively lower than that price point attached to barn-laid or free-range eggs," Mr Kellaway said.

Longest-running land claim now over
The longest-running land claim in the nation is being resolved today in the Gulf of Carpenteria, 700 kilometres south-east of Darwin.
Just over 21,000 hectares across the Sir Edward Pellew Islands, is being officially handed back to the Yanyuwa people, after 30 years of debate.
Many of the original claimants are not alive to see their dream come true, but 71-year-old Steve Johnson says the hand back provides an incentive for others to move back onto traditional lands.
"It's good to see that we are getting our island handed back after so long. There has been a number of deaths in the Yanyuwa and [other] clan groups, 130 all up in that time," Mr Johnson said.
"[But] I think it will make them feel a lot better, that they can move around more freely in their own country.
"The only thing that would be a factor now is the cost of fuel, petrol, diesel stuff like that to get out there.

Grain Council agenda baffles ex-president
Former Grains Council president Keith Perrett says the peak body is losing the confidence of growers and creating divisions in the industry.
Yesterday the council slammed a new survey calling for changes to the single desk for wheat exports, saying Single Vision Grains Australia had no authority to conduct it.
Mr Perrett headed the Grains Council between 2001 and 2005, but claims it is now failing to provide leadership.
He says he is baffled by its current agenda, which seems to be politically-driven.
"Certainly most growers that I speak to say 'what's going on here at the moment'," he said.
"It's a bit beyond me as to why they would be taking that line, you know the easy answer is to say 'well it's a bit of patch protection', I'm not sure what the outcomes are why they've come down the path they are.
"Certainly I'd be taking a different approach to the one that's being taken at the moment."

Corporation's decision may cost timber industry jobs
The timber industry says up to 2,000 jobs are under threat from the Australian Rail Track Corporation's decision to use concrete rather than timber sleepers to upgrade the Melbourne to Brisbane rail line.
The National Association of Forest Industries says saw mill operators were expecting to supply up to 400,000 timber sleepers a year for the next five years.
But the association's Catherine Murphy says they have now been told timber is no longer required.
"It's not just along the Murray there but it's the north coast of New South Wales and I understand sleepers are also produced in Queensland and Western Australia," she said.
"This is a specific market that many of these saw millers have invested $10 million, for example, over the past two years in upgrading their mills specifically to provide timber."

Farming practices blamed for looming mice plague
No-till farming practices and left over seed from last harvest are being blamed for a looming mice plague on South Australia's upper Eyre Peninsula.
Surveys have shown more than 4,000 mice per hectare, the highest number since 1995.
Unlike conventional seeding, sowing crops with the no-till method leaves one distinct furrow for mice to follow and burrow into to eat grain.
Buckleboo farmer Jim Hamlin says the mice are just another problem when they are already facing a cold, dry start to the season.
"Where some of the crops are up, they're chewing off leaves and in other places, where the crops are not up, they've dug under the ground and got the grain as well," he said.

Businesses suffer as dry conditions continue
Dry conditions on pastoral properties south-east of Alice Springs have taken their toll on businesses which service the area.
It has been four years since the region has had any decent rain and stock feed is scarce.
Rodney Mingel, who runs Mingel's Heli Service, has grounded one of three helicopters this season and stood down a pilot.
He says mustering work has been halved, due to the lack of rain and lower stock numbers.
"From now on through to September is really our busy period," he said.
"There's just not much happening, I mean people have done their work, work that they normally do towards the end of the year they've done at the beginning of the year.
"Cattle numbers are down, so there's not six paddocks to muster anymore there's one.

Murray River levels drop
There is concern about the state of the Murray River this winter.
River Murray Water says its storages are only 40 per cent full and has reduced river flows to protect current levels.
With a lack of rain across the catchment as well, parts of the river between Mildura and Swan Hill are only waist deep.
Colignan citrus grower and river boat enthusiast Robert Mansell says the river is as low as he has seen it at this time of year.
"It's really, really interesting," he said.

Rain enables farmers to finish sowing crops
Welcome rain over the grain belt in Western Australia this week has many farmers back out in the paddock to finish sowing crops.
The Western Australian Farmers Federation has surveyed its members and president Trevor De Landgrafft says that for many, the season is a long way behind, after one of the driest May and June periods on record.
"Forty per cent of the respondents have less than half of their crop in the ground," he said.
"Half of those people don't have any crop in at all.
"Sixty per cent of respondents have got more than half their crop in and two thirds of that number somewhere between 80 and one 100 per cent.
"We're saying we think about half the crop that has been sown is out of the ground."

Soft international demand blamed for drop in milk prices
Australia's largest milk processor has lowered the prices it will offer dairy farmers this year.
The move by Murray Goulburn to drop prices by 2.9 per cent follows a 5 per cent cut announced by New Zealand-based Fonterra.
The company's Ian MacAulay is blaming softer international demand.

Green light given to abalone farm
The first land-based abalone farm in New South Wales has been approved on the state's mid-north coast.
Native abalone is under threat from poaching and aquaculture is seen as a way of preserving numbers.
But local conservation groups fear the development could pollute coastal waters and destroy seagrass beds.
Graham Housefield from Australian Bounty Seafoods says he has done everything he can to deal with the concerns.
"I guess what it really comes down to is that the farm needs to have a pristine area because we need water that's as clean as possible and therefore we can't afford to do anything to harm the water from that area," he said.
"These animals are absolutely and totally reliant on having clean water."

Flower growers surprised at banned-seed list
Cut-flower growers are calling for more time to comment on draft changes to seed import regulations.
For the past two months, Biosecurity Australia has been reviewing the Permitted Seeds List.
But tropical flower growers, like Alan Carle, say the review has caught many growers by surprise.
"We are in a process, a review process to dramatically restrict the number of plants and seeds which may be brought into the country in the future," Mr Carle said.
"Effectively, it slams the door shut. We should all just band together and ask for a moratorium so we have time to consider and work in a constructive way with Biosecurity Australia and Quarantine to come up with a system which we are all happy with and doesn't create some sort of black market.
"I mean that's the worst thing that can happen to this country is to get things brought in without proper controls."

US cattle prices not expected to increase
US Agriculture Department officials say it will take years to recover from Japan's mad cow-related ban on beef and producers there should not expect to see massive price rises.
US Agriculture Department livestock analyst Ron Gustafson says Japan's expected reopening of its market to US beef after it completes audits of US plants next month, will not bring a huge upswing in US cattle prices.
Mr Gustafson says it will take years to sell pre-mad cow amounts of US beef to Japan, which only buys certain cuts anyway.
"We don't sell whole carcasses to the Japanese or South Koreans, or anyone ... we sell cuts that, largely, we don't have the large demand for here in the US - short ribs, plates and so-forth - the fattier items," he said.

Drug busting wasps still some time away
Wasps might be known for their bite, but their highly-tuned sense of smell could make them the sniffer dogs of the future.
Trials are under way in the United States to train tiny wasps to detect chemicals.
Dr Andrew Austin from the University of Adelaide says the idea is feasible and wasps are quick learners, but he can not see them replacing dogs any time soon.
"They've been able to demonstrate that you can take these wasps and you can train them to recognise that particular chemical," he said.
"It's a long way from that to actually using this particular wasp in a commercial sense, where you could actually use them as drug busting sort of wasps.

Hotline to help men cope with depression
The impact of the drought has prompted Beyondblue to establish a national hotline specifically to help men deal with depression.
Chairman Jeff Kennett says men from country areas are more likely to suffer from depression, but are less likely to admit the problem.
He says the helpline will provide information, treatment and where to get help.
"Unfortunately depression is very prevalent throughout rural Australia and particularly among young men," he said.
"So what we hope with this Beyondblue information line is to give men the capacity wherever and however isolated their environment may be for the price of a local call to seek direction and help as to what to do in overcoming their depressive illness."
The hotline number, which will be in operation from July 1 is 1300 224 636.
WA-based rural financial counsellor Sue Smith says farmers are traditionally bad at managing stress and many cases are ignored.
She says one of the telltale signs is a change in behaviour.
"It's no wonder that people are feeling really stressed at the moment," she said.
"The first sign is in the body, somebody will start to feel tired, they'll get headaches, their body will start to ache.
"Sometimes it's other people that notice that they become quiet irritable, they may withdraw from their family and friends.

WEA chairman's term extended
The chairman of the Wheat Export Authority (WEA), Tim Besley, will head the regulator for another six months.
Questions have been raised about the authority's effectiveness, in the wake of the AWB scandal.

Sheep chemical declared unsafe
Access to a chemical commonly used to treat flystrike and lice in sheep will be severely restricted after tests showing it is unsafe.
The review of Diazinon was prompted earlier this year after farm workers complained of headaches and in some cases vomiting when using the chemical.
Joan Ashton from the Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority says other chemicals are more costly, but human safety is the priority.
"There's really no way you can mitigate what we think is an unacceptable risk to workers," she said.
"Australia's not the only one looking at Diazinon, there's been a range of reviews that have been going on worldwide and it has progressively been discontinued in other countries, as well, along similar lines and for similar reasons for concern, as we've identified here in Australia."

Ag pilots dispute crash statistics findings
New research from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) says agricultural pilots do not get enough training and are overly represented in crash statistics.
The research, which looked at wire strike accidents where planes hit power lines or other wires, found 65 per cent of low level flying accidents happened in farming.
Head of the Aerial Agricultural Association, Phil Hurst, disputes the findings and says the industry has improved its safety record.

Economic forecaster criticised for livestock price estimates
The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) is again under fire for its forecasts, this time for livestock prices.
Analysts say meat price estimates are probably too low, while production forecasts for beef and lamb are too high.
Bill Cordingley from Rabobank says the beef figures have not taken poor seasons properly into account.

Foster's to sell two wineries
Foster's is set to sell two of its wineries, including the iconic Barossa Seppeltsfield Winery in South Australia.
Also on the market is Rosemount's Denman site in the Hunter Valley and most of its Penfolds site at Nuriootpa in the Barossa Valley.

Honeymoon mine proposal meets more opposition
The proposed Honeymoon uranium mine near Broken Hill has been met with more opposition, with submissions on the project closing today.
Friends of the Earth says the South Australian Government will be going back on an election promise if it allows the mine to go ahead.
Anti-nuclear campaigner Joel Catchlove says the mine is a risky, short-term operation.
"By supporting it, it puts the Rann Government in quite a difficult situation. Because as there simply isn't a mine at Honeymoon at the moment they're both threatening to break their binding SA platform for government and also it goes against their election promises," he said.
"If you've got a four to six years of operation yet it could be permanent ground water contamination in that area."

Mining company hopes to set up rare earth mine in NT
A Northern Territory mining company hopes to have a rare earth mine up and running within five years.
The rare element is a key ingredient for new technology including computer screens, rechargeable batteries and environmentally-friendly hybrid vehicles.
Arafura Resources has already found an 18.6 million tonne deposit about 130 kilometres north of Alice Springs, but managing director Alistair Stephens says they hope to find more in coming months to meet growing demand.

Tax Office focuses on timber plantation records
Companies involved in managed investment schemes are under pressure to get crops in the ground before midnight to meet end of financial year deadlines.
Staff from the Australian Tax Office have been hovering around timber plantations in the far north of Western Australia to confirm paddock plantings match the accounting books.
Tom Cullity from Tropical Forestry Services says his company had a last minute scare with the Tax Commissioner at the door and the discovery that two hectares of indian sandalwood was not accounted for.
"Bearing in mind that the Tax Department was coming up today we thought really we'd better do something," he said.
"I came up and had a look at it and there was obviously a gap there, and said 'hey boys what are we going to do about this' and they all said unprintable words and off we went.

Shareholders show support for dairy group
Shareholders have voted down a push to disband Western Australia's only representative dairy group.
A resolution was put forward late last year to dissolve the organisation, amid claims it had failed to have an impact on the struggling sector.
Following yesterday's vote, director Jim Fremantle says there now needs to be an overhaul of the processing sector.

Rice market regulation ends
Regulation of the domestic rice market will end tomorrow.
Until now all rice grown in New South Wales has had to be sold through the single desk held by Sunrice or the Ricegrowers Co-operative.

Frost damage may push up avocado costs
The price of avocados could be set to rise, with significant frost damage to crops in the Murray Valley.
Freezing conditions a fortnight ago has caused fruit to drop off the trees.
John Eastoe from Mildura Agricultural Contractors says he has lost 60 per cent of his crop, which had an estimated valued of more than half a million dollars.
"We were sitting on probably our best has crop ever, we've been lifting our yields for the last three years but as you can see it's all on the ground," he said.

Katherine School of the Air celebrates anniversary
There will be big celebrations in the Top End town of Katherine tonight, as the School of the Air marks its 40th anniversary.
These days the school serves 220 students.
But in 1966 the first teacher in charge, Ron Smith, began with eight students on HF radio.
"It really made me realise that so much depends on the family," he said.
"They need a tremendous amount of encouragement and support. It worked and I was talking to a family in Darwin and their lad was one of the early students, and they have gone on and travelled overseas and studied overseas.

Mail contractor finally quits 400km mail run
It is a bittersweet day for one outback mail contractor,
After almost 40 years of servicing properties in south-west Queensland, Cecil Russell is retiring
Since 1968 Mr Russell has been making the 400 kilometres round trip from Augathella to Carnarvon Station twice a week and says the scenery is the best part of the job.
"I love the country up there and that's probably why I've been doing it so long, it's a for ever changing sort of thing, seasons change and yes there's a lot of wildflowers at times," he said.
"Every day you get to see a different mob of brumby horses, see quite a few wild dogs and I enjoy just looking at the cattle as I go and that sort of thing.

Rock lobster fishermen to hang up pots
Rock lobster fishermen in Western Australia will today pull their pots for the last time this season.
Most believe this year's catch was down slightly, but prices are the best they've seen in years.
Dongara fisherman Greg Cole says he will enjoy his break over the next four months.
"We're finishing on $32 a kilo which is a lot better than how we started," he said.

Rodeo circuit veterans set for reunion
Some of the nation's golden oldies of the rodeo circuit are heading for a reunion
in western Queensland this weekend.
Veteran bull and bronc riders will meet in Injune, north of Roma, to celebrate the town's return to the professional rodeo circuit for the first time in 33 years.
While they will not be competing, local association president Murray Douglas says they will be enjoying a beer and a catch-up.
"They're coming from all over Australia and they'll be telling a few old stories no doubt about how they used to do it," he said.

Third dairy company announces milk price reductions
Victorian dairy processor Warrnambool Cheese and Butter company has become the third dairy company to announce a drop in its opening prices for milk.
Processors Bonlac and Murray Goulburn announced price reductions for their suppliers earlier this week.

Retiring wine group head predicts industry turnaround
The retiring chairman of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation is predicting a turnaround in the wine industry within the next four years.
David Brownhill steps down today after six years in his government-appointed role.
With grape growers struggling with poor prices and an oversupply, Mr Brownhill does not, however, expect much improvement in the short term.
"I believe in two years' time the light will start to shine at the end of the tunnel, [it] doesn't mean that it's coming out of the tunnel in two years' time, but in four years' time I believe that you'll be right out of the tunnel and then you'll most probably find we'll be a little bit short of red wine for example," he said.

Food safety standards need continual improvement, say scientists
The safety of the food that we eat is emerging as a crucial global trade issue, which can open or block access to markets.
Scientists at the Australian Food Safety Centre say the three main concerns are chemical residues, foreign items in prepared foods and pathogens such as bacteria and viruses.
Professor Tom Ross says pathogenic outbreaks occur at all levels of the food chain from the paddock to the plate and growers, and processors, need to continue to improve safety standards.
He says E. coli bug in the 1980s is an example of how potentially fatal contaminants continue to evolve.
"Twenty years ago that organism had never been seen before," he said.

AWB vows to fight any kickback lawsuits
Wheat exporter AWB says it will fight any legal action launched by American farmers in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal.
Reports suggest the company could face a billion-dollar lawsuit claiming US wheat growers lost trade with Iraq when AWB paid almost $300 million in kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's regime.
The ABC understands the initial case may cover just 20 or so farmers but has the potential to see thousands of US and Canadian farmers join them.
If the action is successful, it could see AWB forced to make a payout triple the value of the kickbacks.
But US Wheat Associates knows nothing of the proposed legal suit at this stage.
AWB spokesperson Peter McBride says AWB would fight any such legal suit.
"Such actions are ill-conceived and if any action is formally brought against AWB we will vigorously defend," he said.
The ABC understands that it is hard to argue the case that US farmers were hurt by AWB kickbacks, because the US had sanctions against trading with Iraq. 

Single desk challenge
AWB has challenged the growing number of proposals calling for changes to the single desk export system.
National wheat pool manager David Johnston has told a public debate in Victoria that AWB will accept the outcome from the oil-for-food inquiry.
But he says if AWB's export monopoly or its veto over grain export applications is removed, wheat growers will be the losers.
"The bulk veto, I think, is a core component of the single desk as we know it and if we have people wanting to send wheat into Indonesia or Malaysia or any of our core markets you'll have Australian wheat competing with Australian wheat," he said.

Electoral boundary change bad for voters: Anderson
The National Party has accused the Australian Electoral Commission of taking the easy way out, by scrapping the federal seat of Gwydir in northern New South Wales.
With a shift in population, New South Wales is required to lose an electorate to accommodate a new seat in Queensland.
The commission wants to merge the seat of Gwydir with Parkes, which will cover almost half the state.
But the retiring Member for Gwydir, former deputy prime minister John Anderson, says the move is a tragedy for country voters.
"I think it's appallingly bad to see people face the prospect of being in a seat that's over twice the size that it is now which makes it far harder for people to access the local member," he said.
"This means one less country voice in Canberra and a lesser chance still of being represented around the Cabinet table.

NFF 'lives in hope' of trade talks breakthrough
The National Farmers Federation (NFF) is confident there is still life in World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks, despite another failure to reach agreement on agriculture over the weekend.
United States and European negotiators went into the talks saying they were prepared to move on farm reforms.
However, negotiators in Geneva say those nations have failed to match their rhetoric with action.
An agreement on agriculture is the crucial first step in securing broader trade deals around industrial goods and services.
Trade policy manager with the NFF, Scott Mitchell, says while it is been a frustrating process is not over yet.
"WTO is the main game," Mr Mitchell said.
"We live in hope that ministers will go home and reflect on what's happened here this week and will realise that we do have a narrow window of opportunity to make global trading rules better for a long time.

Cold start to winter cuts rainfall
The freezing start to winter across southern Australia could be causing the ongoing dry weather conditions.
In normal years, cold air from the Southern Ocean collides with warm air from central Australia resulting in cut-off lows, which bring rainfall.
But this year, the systems are not as strong.
Dr Peter McIntosh, from the Marine Atmospheric Research Centre, says that is because it is colder inland.
"We've speculated a little bit recently about what might be causing these cut-off lows to decrease in intensity," he said.
"We think it is a decrease in the north-south temperature gradient.

Coroner blames bushfire on powerline
An electricity provider in New South Wales has been blamed for causing a major bushfire in the state's central west two years ago.
The deputy state coroner has found the fire started near Parkes, when a tree touched a Country Energy powerline.
The 2004 fire burnt 6,000 hectares, causing the death of 690 sheep and the destruction of thousands of hectares of unharvested crops on 28 farms.
Craig Ward says he is relieved the four-day inquest quashed rumours that his farming machinery sparked the blaze.
"I just gave evidence that I wasn't in the vicinity of where the fire started," he said.
"Through the GPS system on the harvester it plots every two seconds where the harvester has been over the period of time your harvesting."
Mr Ward says he was frustrated by the approach of Country Energy to the trial, which tried to prove his harvester sparked the blaze.

Ord River Irrigation Scheme expansion approved
The long-awaited second stage development of the Ord River Irrigation Scheme in Western Australia's far north has been given the green light.
Tenders have been called by the WA Government, which has settled environmental and native title issues surrounding the development.
The expansion of the Ord River Irrigation Scheme will make 16,000 hectares of irrigated farmland available.
The Government says it is seeking expressions of interest for development of between 7,000 and 16,000 hectares of land.
Resources Minister John Bowler says land could be available for planting as soon as 2008.
"We believe we can quadruple the amount of hectares placed under agriculture in irrigation," he said.
"This will make the Ord Valley one of the most significant agricultural areas in Australia."

Nurse practitioners scheme upsets doctors
Rural doctors in Tasmania claim they are being devalued by the introduction of nurse practitioners in remote areas.
Following the lead of other states, the Tasmanian Government will allow nurses to prescribe drugs and undertake some of the traditional tasks of doctors to fill shortages.
But the president of Rural Doctors Tasmania, Eric Calquoun, says nurses should remain an integral part of GP-led health care teams and not be allowed to practice independently.
"I think this is the thin edge of the wedge with this," he said.
"We're talking about prescribing major drugs, the Poisons Acts regulations are being modified so they can prescribe morphine for palliative care nurses.

Managed investment schemes under review
Concerns are emerging over the shift in managed investment schemes (MIS) from forestry and vineyards to broader agriculture.
Plantings of walnuts and avocados are among those now being offered to investors.
Rob Dalton, from Avocados Australia, says he is concerned by the push, which could massively distort the market.
"Reviews of MISs have indicated that the investors are in there primarily for the tax deduction and they have much less concern with profitability at the end of the project," he said.
"Whereas the normal farmer is in there for a profit and a long-term, sustainable profit.
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran is also concerned about the impact of MISs.
"When they start going into wine grapes and citrus and avocadoes where there is well-established Australian industries, that is of enormous concern," he said.

WA farmers back single wheat desk
The Western Australian Farmers Federation has called for the single desk wheat marketing system to be kept, even if AWB does not operate it.
Despite claims it is not a policy turnaround, it is the first time the federation has appeared to have reservations about AWB's future management of the single desk.
President Trevor de Landgrafft says the power of veto must stay with the single desk, but who manages it has come under scrutiny.

Feedlot demand outstrips grain production
Queensland feedlot owners are being told they may have to buy grain to feed cattle from Western Australia, if local production does not increase.
The Department of Primary Industries says demand for feed grains like barley, sorghum and wheat is expected to outstrip local supplies five out of every 10 years.
Kym McIntyre says feedlots already consume about 2 million tonnes of grain a year, with a further 1 million tonnes likely to be needed over the next five years.

Feral pigs destroy Ingham crops
Farmers in north Queensland say they are being overwhelmed by feral pigs.
Ingham cane farmer Tony Palmas believes the devastation of cyclone Larry could have forced many pigs out of their usual haunts to find food.
Mr Palmas says he has lost crops worth up to $20,000.
He says shooting the pigs is not working and there is no fruit available to use in traps.
"We used to get bananas from north like Innisfail and Tully but for the moment there's no bananas coming from there and there's no mangoes or anything like that," he said.

Locust fears prompt chemicals buy-up
Following warnings Western Australia is facing a huge locust plague this spring, the State Government has allocated more than $3 million towards the purchase of chemicals to control plagues.
Minister for Agriculture Kim Chance says if untreated, locusts could cost the state more than $100 million.
It is thought big summer rains have contributed to heavy egg laying this year.
Mr Chance says farmers have to prepare for major damage.
"It's not, in terms of area, quite as big as the spring 2000 infestation was, which covered about, looks to me on the map, two to three times the areas," he said.

VegMachine gives farmers eye in the sky
Landholders across the northern rangelands of Australia can now use satellite monitoring to keep track of environmental changes on their properties.
The new system, which is called VegMachine, has been trialed across 80,000 square kilometres in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland.
NT Government researcher Luke Peel wants to see the free computer software program used more widely.
"It gives you a birdseye view of the property," he said.
"The idea is the mystery of satellite imagery, what it can say and do is being exposed back.
"It still hasn't got to the point where we can actually work out kilograms per hectare on the ground.
"But, it certainly gives an idea of how productivity can be related to use of the resources or trapping of the resources available.
"Whether it's the actual vegetation, the soils or the nutrients in the soil."

Lachlan CMA outlines tender process
The Lachlan Catchment Management Authority (CMA) has outlined how the tender process will work for part of its latest round of incentive funding. The latest round opened last month and will close at the end of this month. Kieran Hawker, from the Lachlan CMA, says the tender process will bring a positive outcome for the environment and producers.

Crop growth slow across the region
The district agronomist with the Department of Primary Industries, Jan Edwards, says frosts in Cowra have seen germination of wheat and canola crops slow down. Ms Edwards says weeds will be a big problem as a lot of crop was dry sown and so weeds will emerge with the crops. This will be similar to last year. 

Truck hits mob of sheep
A warning to motorists across the region. A truck hit a mob of 5,000 sheep near Condobolin, killing 15 lamb wethers yesterday morning. Police say the drover was moving the stock on the West Wyalong Road south of Condobolin when they were hit by the concrete truck. Police says it is believed the truck driver did not take notice of stock moving signs. The driver is to be issued with an infringement notice for failing to give way to stock.

Draft chicken meat import ruling worries industry
The chicken meat industry says a decision to allow imports into Australia could pose an unnecessary risk to consumers.
In a draft import risk analysis, Biosecurity Australia recommends allowing uncooked chicken meat into the country, as long as exporting countries can prove they are free of diseases, including bird flu.
But Dr Andreas Dubs, from the Australian Chicken Meat Federation, is questioning whether Australia can be certain about another country's disease status.
"That is not a simple matter," he said.
"It really comes down to the confidence that we can have with the systems in place which in the past I suppose has been shown to be somewhat questionable."
While Australian quarantine officers usually double-check disease free claims from other countries, some say that is not always a guarantee.
Peter Scott, from the Australian Veterinary Poultry Alliance, says authorities rely on getting accurate information from producers.
"Regulatory authorities can only go on the information provided to them and in some cases that may not be accurate," Mr Scott said.
"We do see overseas quite a bit of product moving through countries.
"In other words, while you believe you're getting product from a particular country it may be coming in via another country."

Animal-based fertilisers threaten BSE status: vet
Tasmania's chief vet says Australia's status as being free of mad cow disease (BSE) could be threatened by the indiscriminate use of animal-based pasture fertilisers.
A number of cattle deaths from botulism in Tasmania have been attributed to the use of poultry litter as a fertiliser.
Dr Rod Andrewarthur says although it is a legal product, the litter must not be used before the end of the official withholding period to ensure cattle do not ingest any lingering animal protein.
He says under BSE protocols, no animal protein can be fed to cattle.
"We sell our meat to the world as a premium because we are free of diseases like mad cow disease," he said.
"We are under audit from other countries like the European Union to make sure that we've got all the checks and safeguards in place prevent the development of the disease.

Processing delays force saleyard's NLIS overhaul
Processing delays of up to 24 hours have forced Australia's biggest saleyards to overhaul its National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) infrastructure.
With 11,000 cattle on offer today, new in-pen scanning is being put to the test at the Roma Saleyards in Queensland.
A year after NLIS became mandatory in the state, the saleyards' board is scrapping two run-through scanners worth $270,000.
While they read tags with 99 per cent efficiency, large volumes of cattle mean even minor misreads could cause huge disruptions.
Brisbane-based company Livestock Link has been contracted to pick up any missing tags and non-reader tags more efficiently, by pre-scanning cattle before sales in pens.

Ethics campaigners push for teminator gene ban
Gene ethics campaigners are lobbying the Federal Government to ban the development of terminator technology in Australia.
The process would stop seed from breeding naturally, forcing farmers to buy new stocks each year instead of growing their own.
More than 10,000 people have signed a petition claiming genetic engineering companies will have monopoly power if the technology is introduced.
The Government has said it will accept development applications on a case-by-case basis.
However, Bob Phelps from the GeneEthics Network says that is not acceptable.
"There's clearly strong public sentiment that the terminator is not acceptable," he said.
"We're submitting those petitions to the federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran and we're saying to the Australian Government we want you to align the Australian Government policy with the global view that it's unacceptable and that the global ban on terminator should remain."

VFF pushes for single wheat desk changes
The Victorian Farmers Federation (VFF) has joined growing calls for changes to the single desk for wheat exports, in the wake of the oil-for-food Inquiry.
Under its plan, wheat exporter AWB Limited and AWB International would be split, with international wheat sales returned to farmer control.
The VFF will seek endorsement for the proposal from the Grains Council of Australia later this month.
VFF grains group president Ian Hastings says the plan addresses concerns about governance of the system, and payments to growers from the national wheat pool.
"We're talking about separation of AWB International and making sure that AWB International continues to have the legislative monopoly for exports of wheat," Mr Hastings said.

Fodder exports demand raises local prices
A booming export fodder market is good news for growers but farmers looking to feed livestock in Australia are facing high prices and short supply.
Lucerne prices have almost doubled since November to around $300 a tonne, while hay prices are up between $30 and $40 a tonne.
Colin Peace, from the Fodder Industry Association, says drought in the US and Canada is helping to boost exports, at the expense of the domestic market.
"Those two markets often clash for supply so I think you could anticipate that certainly continuing," he said.
"There are always opportunities for stocks that are destined for export to be diverted for domestic demand.

AWGA seeks unified wool industry vision
There are calls today for a single vision for the wool industry, uniting research, development and commerical operations to pull it out of the current slump.
The Australian Wool Growers Association (AWGA) says the industry's four main bodies - Australian Wool Innovation, Australian Wool Services, the wool testing authority, and wool exchange - are too inward-looking and duplicate services.
AWGA chairman, Martin Oppenheimer, says industry leaders should follow the lead of the sheepmeat industry, which turned its fortunes around with a strategic plan 10 years ago.
"We've got many different grower-owned or funded companies and they're all heading off in their own directions," he said.
"They've got different strategies.

Truck crash prompts stock movements warning
Police in New South Wales are warning drivers to be more careful on country roads, after a crash involving a cement truck and a mob of 5,000 sheep.
The mob was being run along a stock route in the state's central-west.
Detective Senior Constable Andrew McGrath says police believe the driver ignored stock warning signs.
"A vehicle travelling on a road about 15 kilometres from Condobolin collided with a mob of sheep that were being driven along the road, with 15 fatalities," he said.
"The driver of the truck I believe will be issued with an infringement notice for failing to give way to stock.
"Because the conditions have been so dry there are a lot of mobs moving around on the roads so people should be wary when they are travelling on country roads.

Nullabor pastoralists granted rent subsidies
Pastoralists on the Nullarbor who are suffering through drought conditions have been offered a sweetener by the West Australian Government.
They have been told they are not eligible for exceptional circumstances funding, but the Government will contribute $80,000 towards pastoral lease rents and agriculture protection rates.
Pastoralist Rod Campbell says the money is welcome but pastoralists still believe they should be eligible for EC funds.
"We're mystified about the criteria etc but I think the Minister's addressing that very nicely," he said.

Inquiry likely to recommend geosequestration: researcher
Researchers believe a federal Parliament inquiry will help find funding for more projects to stop greenhouse gases from coal, oil and gas fields entering the atmosphere.
The House of Representatives Science and Innovation Committee will investigate the benefits and risks of geosequestration, which is capturing carbon dioxide from mining and storing it underground for millions of years.
Trials are being carried out in Victoria's Otway Basin and off the Western Australian coast.
Dr Peter Cook, from the Co-operative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies, says studies are making progress.
"We're very confident that that inquiry is going to endorse the use of this technology as one of the options for decreasing CO2 emissions," he said.

Wine grape ethanol trial under way
A 12-month trial producing ethanol from wine grapes has begun in South Australia.
Tarac Technologies in the Barossa Valley currently distills alcohol from winery waste.
The company will supply South Australian Farmers Fuel with 100,000 litres of biofuel over the next 12 months.
Spokesman Chris Zajac says it remains to be seen if the process can be economically viable.
"The reason we've decided to run the trial is to basically see how it performs against other ethanols in the marketplace," he said.

Hayes to head international wine body
An Australian has been named president of the peak international body representing winemakers and grapegrowers from 42 nations.
Peter Hayes will head up the International Organisation for Wine and Vine for the next three years.
The organisation sets industry standards and regulations for all member countries
Mr Hayes, a director and former chief executive of the Grape and Wine Research Development Council, says he was taken aback by his appointment.
"I find it a bit surprising quite frankly, but I think it is a sign of the times," he said.

Consumers switch to Homebrand products
New figures show Homebrand products like milk, sugar and butter already account for more than 50 per cent of sales through the major supermarkets.
Frozen and canned Homebrand vegetables and dried fruits are also becoming more popular, according to research by accountancy firm KPMG.
Food processors are starting to feel the pressure, as supermarkets aim to fill one-third of their shelves with their own labels.
KPMG's Adrian Arundell says the processing sector will shrink, as other brands disappear.
"Some of them are fighting head on against it, some of them are actually working with it," he said.

Tin mill's closure to force can imports
In a further blow for the manufacturing industry, tinned fruit and vegetable processors will have to import cans from next year, after the closure of Australia's only tin mill.
High iron ore prices have lead BlueScope Steel to shut its Port Kembla mill.
That will force canneries to either import tin or look for alternative packaging.
The head of the Food and Grocery Council, Dick Wells, says increased costs are putting manufacturing under a lot of pressure.
"People need to be aware that it's tough all the way and there's no easy life here," he said.
"If we're not innovative in this country in looking for ways to take costs out of the structure and produce products that consumers see additional benefits in, then there won't be a future."

Organic farmers eye overseas markets
The United States, Europe and South-East Asia are potential markets for Australian-grown organic products, according to a report launched last night.
The report by the Rural Industries and Development Corporation looks at the demographics of consumers, and what drives them to buy organic food.
Andre Leu, from the Organic Federation of Australia, says in the long-term, China will be a major market, although Australia will struggle to compete with its domestic production.
"The latest figures that we have from China show that their industry is worth $US8 billion, which makes them one of the largest organic markets in the world," he said.

Farmers dispute Costello's federalism reform plans
The New South Wales Farmers' Association is backing Federal Treasurer Peter Costello in his criticism of Australia's three-tiered system of government, but does not agree with his plans to change it.
Mr Costello has triggered national debate on federalism, by wanting to wrestle all responsibility for utilities and the economy from the state governments, reducing them to branch offices.
Mal Peters, from the association, says giving more power to Canberra is not the answer, and is calling for full-scale reform of Australia's system of government.
"Any further centralisation of power into New South Wales is not good," he said.
"I mean the closer the government gets to the people the better the government is, and that's well recognised by all players in the state and federal spheres.

'Iron Boomerang' plans onshore iron ore processing
The resources sector is investigating a $55 billion proposal to process iron ore in Australia from 2011.
The 'Iron Boomerang' would be a privately-funded 3,000 kilometre railway to link iron ore deposits in Western Australia with coal fields in north Queensland's Bowen Basin.
Blast furnaces to be build at either end of the tracks would produce pig iron for the export market.
An international trade delegation is touring the town of Bowen today to investigate the project.
Shane Condon, from Project Iron Boomerang, says supply chain savings alone could be worth $2 billion per year.
"When trains run empty and ships are coming back from China, or in the Pilbarra, or in the coal fields of Queensland, the return trip for these giant empty trains and ships is 45 per cent of the total trip cost and that is highly inefficient and using fuels unnecessarily," he said.

City vet students try country practice
Veterinary students in Western Australia have traded the dogs and cats of city practices for a stint on a remote cattle property in the Pilbara region.
About 1,600 kilometres from Perth, Warrawagine Station is a long way from home for two vet students, who have never done any work with cattle before.
But student Kate Louden says six weeks on 1 million acre station is a unique experience.
"I didn't realise quite how isolated the station is - 300 kilometres from the nearest shop," she said.
"We've been mustering so we've been moving the yards and drafting the cattle from different blocks.
"[We've] been up in the plane and the chopper a few times so it's been great.

Trucking industry looks to recruit foreign drivers
The trucking industry wants to start employing migrant workers, as driver shortages and an ageing workforce continue to cause problems.
Current skilled migrant visas do not allow for truck drivers but the Australian Trucking Association (ATA) is confident it can get the industry reclassified as a skilled occupation.
The ATA's Damien MacFarlane says it is a worldwide problem, and Australia will face competition from other countries hoping to recruit drivers.
"You'll find the United States and the United Kingdom are currently facing the same challenge," he said.
"There's many drivers being poached from Australia and have gone to either the United Kingdom or the United States to drive.
"It's fine to say let's go and get migrant drivers, where are you going to get them from? And that's going to be the challenge." 

Dry conditions see live sheep exports jump
Dry seasonal conditions in Western Australia have seen a massive jump in live sheep exports from Fremantle.
More than 330,000 sheep were shipped out last month alone.
John Edwards, from the WA Livestock Exporters Association, says there is a direct link between the increase and the weather.
"I guess farmers have sort of looked ahead of themselves as to availability of feed stocks on farm and very little paddock feed," he said.
"They've most probably made the decision to sell sheep early.
"Possibly we've seen a lot of sheep come out now rather than in the spring when they traditionally shear and sell off shears."
Meanwhile, easing cattle prices in the east are providing northern WA producers with competition in the live export trade.
Tony Cooling, from Landmark in Broome, says Queensland producers are now selling stock overseas.
"Queensland prices have come back a bit, so live export is now competing with the domestic market over there," he said.

'Beef only' cattle granted entry to Qld
Queensland has opened its borders to cattle from Victoria and the BJD control zone in New South Wales, as long as it's classed as "beef only".
The state had previously banned cattle due to concerns over the disease bovine Johne's.
Cattle which have not been run with dairy cows for five years, or grazed on land which has run dairy cattle within 12 months, will meet the classification.
Michael McCormack, from the Cattle Council, says it's a successful outcome.
"Especially for southern producers it's a good news story," he said.

Canada continues mad cow tests
Canadian authorities are continuing tests on a suspected sixth case of mad cow disease (BSE).
The cow was born before feed bans were put in place in 1997, and was discovered under new surveillance programs.
Final tests are due next week.

Frost hits Riversun's US exports
A company exporting citrus fruit to the United States says shipments are likely to drop 20 per cent this season, due to frost damage in the Murray Valley, Riverland and Riverina.
Riversun chairman Peter Walker says supermarkets in the US are aware of the damage to the Victorian and South Australian crops, but he is confident sales will not be affected.
"It's one of the transparencies that Riversun has," he said.
"It goes out and tells the customer base that we have procedures and policies in place and it's adhering to them.
"If it's minus two for more than four hours properties are put into suspension until they are assessed to see if there is any damage on that property, so we've explained that to supermarkets and they are all still on board." 

Dairy farmers form collective bargaining group
Tasmanian dairy farmers who supply food giant National Foods have formed the state's first collective bargaining group.
About 30 farmers have come together to negotiate future supply and price contracts.
The chairman of the group, Kem Perkins says the move was inevitable.
"It's the only way we could go to negotiate a price because under the rules and the law these days you can't negotiate price as an individual," he said.
"You can't even put in on the agenda when you have a suppliers' group meeting so the way we've set it up ... means that we can talk to any company, negotiate with any company and we can take on board any suppliers that conform to the conditions."
One of the first jobs for the bargaining group will be to negotiate extra time for next season's price talks.

Renewable fuel plant nears completion
Work on the nation's biggest renewable fuel plant in Darwin is almost complete.
Natural Fuels Australia will import Malaysian palm oil to produce biodiesel later this year.
Charles Darwin University was commissioned to compare traditional diesel with a 20 per cent biodiesel blend.
Researcher Mark Thiele says emissions were reduced.
"Carbon dioxide emissions went up slightly but primarily because of the reduction in hydro carbon and carbon monoxide," he said.
"We also didn't actually notice very much difference in power or torque.
"Particularly at the 20 per cent blend, which is what we were testing, was only about 1 per cent."
But Mr Thiele says it is not clear how sustainable it will be to import palm oil.
"From a sustainability perspective it's probably a little bit more complicated," he said.
"We have to look at the whole cycle of biodiesel production and the feed stock.
"It was really outside the scope of the research work that we did." 

Mary River dam decision outrages farmers
Farmers near Gympie remain outraged with the Queensland Government, despite its decision to scale back the size of a proposed new dam on the Mary River.
Premier Peter Beattie initially planned a 660,000 megalitre dam, which would have consumed almost 1,000 properties.
But he now says a smaller dam will be built, with the resumption of 500 properties.
Under the three-stage plan, the dam wall would be raised if more water is needed in 2035.
But locals at a public meeting to hear the details were furious, saying they will be left in limbo for 30 years.
"I've been living here 30 years and been waiting to retire," one said.
"I'd been retired one week when he dropped this bombshell."
Another resident said: "Some people in stage one will get bought out there's no doubt if they proceed, and so they've divided the community even more.
"And they left these people in stage two to whither on the vine."

Competition will cut farmers' market share: study
A new report says in the next 10 years Australian farmers will lose market share to developing countries like China, Brazil and India.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations have compared 15 commodities.
They have found that as developing nations increase production and become more competitive, countries like the US, EU and Australia will lose out in world agricultural trade.
Australian exports of sugar, beef, rice and pigmeat will be hardest hit, with less impact on wheat and poultry.
Trade analyst Peter Gallagher says although world trade rules will play a part, global export competition is on the rise.
"The world is not beating a path to our door looking for primary products," he said.
"The opportunities for Australia are now going to be much more in the processed food area and in the fresh foods and ingredients areas.
"It is important that we realise many developing countries are becoming more effective producers of primary products and we need to look at the structure of our own production for the future."

Apple growers look to boost productivity
Australian apple growers are investigating ways to make their orchards more efficient, to compete with the low production costs of other countries.
The industry will set up 60 trial sites around the country to compare different planting styles.
The chairman of Apple and Pear Australia, Darral Ashton, says one option is to double the number of trees per hectare, using dwarf root stock.
"The trees don't take the usual say four or five years to come into production - they come into production very easily," he said.
"Because you have so many trees per hectare, each tree doesn't have to carry so many apples to get that high production per hectare.

Climate change threatens blackcurrant industry
There is a warning today that Tasmania's niche blackcurrant industry is under threat from global warming.
Plant pathologist Steve Wilson says there has been a progressive drop in yields over the past 15 years because of a sharp increase in extremely cold nights.
Mr Wilson is trialing other black currant varieties in an attempt to boost yields, but says he is not hopeful.
"This, I think, may be the canary in the coal mine," he said.
"It is showing that climate change can impact on commercial crops.
"w We've often thought of climate change as something that can impact on natural populations, but here it is having quite a distinct impact, quite a distinct economic one, on a small industry."

Copper find excites stock market investors
A small copper explorer has shot out of obscurity after discovering rich veins of the metal near Cloncurry, in north-west Queensland.
Shares in Australian Mining Investment shot from 29 cents seven weeks ago to a top of $10 yesterday, turning it into a billion-dollar company.
It says drilling at its Rocklands copper deposit is continuing around the clock to feed the stock market more news.
Hartley's mining expert Rob Brierley says little is known so far about the Rocklands deposit.
"Not very much at all - I think that's what captured the imagination of the market," he said.
"In fact it's really been a meteoric rise.
"There is a long way for this company to go, but it's great to see that a discovery can still capture the imagination of the investment public."
Shares in Australian Mining Investment are in a trading halt.

Korean missile tests boost oil price
The price of crude oil has hit a record high in the United States overnight after North Korea launched a series of missiles into the Sea of Japan.
The price of crude oil settled at a $US75.19 a barrel.
The prices of gold and silver were also affected. 

Coles backs inland rail link proposal
Coles Myer has backed plans for an inland rail link between Brisbane and Melbourne but supporters of the project say that is not enough to get it off the ground.
The head of the Australian Transport and Energy Corridor, Everald Compton, says governments will be the key to the $4 billion rail network.
Coles Myer has lodged a submission to a Productivity Commission inquiry into the nation's freight system, saying the inland project would help to make rail more efficient.
But Mr Compton says it is now in the hands of government.
"The Coles Myer thing won't make any difference because other people have said that before," he said.
"For instance, Woolworths said it some years ago and governments took no notice of them."

Snowy inquiry head attacks 'secrecy culture'
The head of a New South Wales Government inquiry into ongoing public ownership of the Snowy Hydro-Electric Scheme says he is trying to break down a culture of secrecy within the authority.
A proposed $3 billion float of the state and federal-owned power and irrigation provider was scuttled in the wake of public protest last month.
At a hearing in the Snowy Mountains town of Cooma yesterday, inquiry chairman Gordon Moyes said he heard evidence of a systematic, long-term lack of transparency by Snowy Hydro.
"There's been an absolute failure in terms of communication, not just recently, it's been a culture that's come to us from evidence for at least 20 years," he said.
"Who told them not to communicate, who actually authorised the change in nature of the company's businesses?
"They are very significant and important questions and will determine the results of the inquiry."
The final report is due on October 27.

Sea rangers meet in Arnhem Land
One hundred sea rangers from more than 14 different language groups across Arnhem Land are meeting this week, at the Aboriginal community of Maningrida, 550 kilometres from Darwin.
Aboriginal land makes up 85 per cent of the Territory coastline and while the conference is an opportunity to share skills and ideas, the main focus is finding a secure funding to continue their work.

Kulukuk farm mud crab trial breeds success
A Darwin Aboriginal community has succeeded in growing out its first farmed mud crabs, as part of a commercial trial.
So far 600 crabs weighing an average of 350 grams have been sold to wholesalers.
The trial is part of a Commonwealth Government Shared Responsibility Agreement.
The Kululuk farm employs eight people, including traditional owner Jacqueline Treves.
"We seem to be one of the first people in Darwin to grow our own mud crab farm," she said.
"Now that we have got one, we just want to make it work for us and our children.
"It's important because we want good jobs for younger Indigenous people and for our own children.

Country women gather for field day
Almost 150 women made their way to Buntine in the West Australian Wheatbelt for the annual Liebe Women's field day yesterday.
Those who attended say it was a good opportunity to get away from the farm and socialise with other farming women who are also struggling with the dry start to 2006.
"These sorts of days are even more important when you realise you're actually not alone and that everybody's going through the same pain," said Sally Lee from the Wubin district.

US growers slam 'sham' Australian wheat deal
US Wheat Associates has accused Australia of putting together a sham deal to sell wheat to Iraq.
Loading has begun in Geelong of the first shipment of wheat to Iraq since a ban was imposed on trade with AWB earlier this year.
US Wheat Associates claims the Wheat Australia consortium's 350,000 tonne contract is just a way for AWB to get around the ban.
It accuses AWB of selling to Iraq from its wheat pool through the consortium.
Rebecca Coleman says AWB still controls the pricing.
"We think that the Wheat Australia situation is pretty much a shell game, a sham and a way that allows for AWB to continue to funnel wheat to Iraq and avoid the sanctions that are currently in place," she said.
Ms Coleman says Iraq is now one of the US's top 10 wheat customers.

Dry weather hits WA grain harvest
Western Australian broadacre farmers could be confronting one of their worst harvest seasons in history, after another month of warm and unseasonably dry conditions.
The state's grain handler and marketer, Co-operative Bulk Handling, had earlier predicted that summer subsoil moisture would help produce a crop of around 11 million tonnes, despite an historically dry start to winter.
But operations manager David Fienberg says the entire state's yield could now be as low as 7 million tonnes.
"What we're concerned about is keeping farmers on farm and of course that directly relates to their profitability and of course that comes from volume," he said.
"My gut feeling is that lupins are going to be considerably down compared to where they might have been given that early break in summer, I think canola also going to be substantially down."

Poor harvest sends farmers to other jobs
As the dry spell continues in Western Australia, young farmers are already starting to consider their options off-farm.
Many farmers are opting not to put a crop in this year.
Wes Teakle, from Northampton, is going to build sheds because there is no money to be made on the land this year.
"I know of half a dozen guys, just off the top of my head, that are doing the same thing that I'm doing and looking for alternate work," he said.
"Unfortunately there's not enough room for all of us in a small town like Northampton or Geraldton.

Cowra abattoir cleared over sackings
The Cowra abattoir in New South Wales has been cleared over its decision to dismiss 29 employees under the new WorkChoices laws, and re-hire some under a different award.
The Office of Workplace Services has found the company did not break the new laws, and its actions would still have been lawful under the old legislation.
The Federal Government says it has been vindicated by the ruling.

Anderson urged to put off retirement
Former deputy prime minister John Anderson is reportedly being urged by the National Party to shelve his retirement plans, to try to stop his federal seat from being abolished.
The Nationals say the Australian Electoral Commission's plan to merge the Gwydir electorate with Parkes in New South Wales is an attack on country Australia.
As well as urging the commission to hear community concerns firsthand, Gwydir Electorate Council chairman, Mark Coulton, wants people of all political persuasions to lobby against the proposal.
"John made the point yesterday that if he was still the deputy prime minister, would Gwydir have been abolished?" he said.
"I think everyone knows the answer would be no, so whether John stays or not is a different issue.
"A simple solution like that I think we're too far down the track for that." 

Commonwealth urged to heed environmental management survey
The first survey of how farmers are managing the environment shows more than 90 per cent are undertaking improvement works.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics research also shows most farmers consider weeds, pests and native vegetation to be their biggest concerns.
Farmer groups say the findings should influence the Federal Government, which is deciding how to fund natural resource management.
Corey Watts, from the Conservation Foundation, says a range of factors influence the amount of time and money farmers spend on conservation works.
"A lot has to do with the ability of people to be able to receive the kinds of resources that they need to plan and undertake works at different scales," he said.
"Drought is a big one - a number of parts of the country are in drought and that really does stuff up people's ability to do what needs to be done in the long-term.

Rural Commodity Index rises 8pc
Agricultural commodity prices remain strong, with the Westpac-National Farmers Federation Rural Commodity Index up nearly 8 per cent compared to this time last year.
Dairy is the only sector which has fallen below last year's level.
In the past month, barley, canola, cotton and wool have gone up, with small falls in sugar and beef.
Justin Smirk, from Westpac, says while prices are pretty good at the moment, next year could be a different story if the world economy slows down.
"However, as you move into 2007, those positive price responses will mean you'll get a supply response," he said.
"In addition, with interest rates around the world rising, does suggest it will be a softer year.

Rig demand delays geosequestration trial
Researchers say the first Australian trial of technology to try to trap greenhouse gases underground is being delayed.
The $30 million geosequestration project in south-west Victoria aims to test whether carbon dioxide from coal burning power stations and gas mining can be stored underground.
The Federal Government has funded the project as one of its preferred ways of combating climate change.
The project's leader, Dr Peter Cook, says preliminary tests are being carried out but he does not expect to be able to start pumping carbon dioxide underground until next year.
"A lot of people want to drill for oil at the moment so it's a bit hard to get rigs," he said.
"Also it's a constraint on us that costs have generally gone up.
"We're not a major company, we're a research organisation with limited funds so we have to be rather careful the way that we use those funds.

Cattle killers thought highly organised
Police in Western Australia suspect there may be an organised network killing pastoral cattle to sell their meat.
Seven cows have been reported butchered on Pilbara stations in the past month, and police believe there may be more which have not been reported.
Pastoralist Richard Climas, from Mardie Station 150 kilometres west of Karratha, says cattle theft is becoming a regular occurrence.
"I've found a few carcasses, generally only the legs and hide left, and they've taken the whole lot," he said.
"It happens quite often. A good bull at the moment is probably worth $600, $700 a beast, it adds up pretty quick.
"What else are they doing while they're out there?
"If they're brazen enough to kill a beast what else are they going to be doing while they're out and about?
"We've had solar panels stolen and all sorts of stuff stolen."
Further north in the Kimberley, the state's stock squad says there has been significant cattle thefts over the past 12 months.

Cane smut found on 30 properties
Sugar cane smut has now been found on 30 farms in the Childers area of south-east Queensland.
The disease, which can cause major crop losses, was found for the first time on the east coast less than a month ago.
Chris Adriaanson, from Queensland's Department of Primary Industries, says the disease will not be eradicated.
He says in the future, farmers will have to rely on resistant crop varieties to eliminate the impact of the disease.
"It depends on what you define as eradication," he said.
"If eradicating means biologically extinguishing the disease, then that's never been the objective, it's not part of the way we have to do this business.

Abattoir closure to impact on livestock producers
Livestock producers in South Australia's north say they will be hit by higher freight costs, after the closure of Conroy's abattoir at Port Pirie.
The plant closed on Friday and sold to T and R Pastoral, which has no plans to reopen it in the short-term.
One hundred people were employed at the abattoir.
Sandy Morris from Yardea Station in the Gawler Ranges says it will cost him up to $5 a head more to send stock to the meatworks at Murray Bridge instead.
"The impact on us will be that we won't have the option to send them to Pirie which is the closest abattoir for us," he said.
"We'd have to send them on to Murray Bridge, which would be double the amount of freight.
"I'm not quite sure how far Murray Bridge would be from Pirie but it would have to be another 250 [kilometres] I'd imagine. Probably looking at something like $2.50-$5.00."
Meanwhile an abattoir at Stanthorpe, in southern Queensland, says it had to temporarily shut down this morning after temperatures dropped to -20.
The Bureau of Meteorology has reported temperatures of minus six at nearby Warwick and Applethorpe.
John Allan from Don Allan and Co says the abattoir's hot water system froze.
"We still haven't started work because the cold outside froze the pressure of the steam inside our steam valves," he said.
"It just blew from sheer pressure, so that's letting all the steam out now, so we have to replace that now.

Australians crave roast dinner: anthropologist
A visiting anthropologist claims the Australian love of a good roast dinner is healthy and in our genes.
Dr Lionel Tiger is being sponsored by Meat and Livestock Australia, which has run a campaign linking human brain evolution to the consumption of meat.
Dr Tiger says a survey has found 78 per cent of Australians rate a roast as among their all-time favourite meals and it is a more natural craving than those for sugar and fat-rich processed foods.
"Australian beef is grass-fed and a lot of the hostility to beef depends in part on the American style of making beef which is grain-fed and therefore much fattier," he said.

Citrus growers set to export to China
Strict quarantine measures have finally been agreed upon to send citrus fruit into China, with the first exports due to leave later this month.
Growers had hoped China would help solve some of Australia's oversupply problems, but Judith Damiani says it is not yet known how much fruit will be exported this year.
Ms Damiani says prices are also uncertain.
"The quarantine requirements make it fairly difficult to put a lot of volume of fruit into that China market," she said.
"So we will have to start very slowly, we'll have to do some trial shipments initially and after two years we will have to look at amending the protocol and making it easier to ship there."
Richie Roberts from Renmark says his fruit company will start packing fruit for China early next week.
"We're very keen to get several containers to China just to test the market because there's so much work that the industry's put in to get access," he said.

Wine exports jump
Wine exports jumped 12 per cent during the last financial year but prices suffered, according to new figures from the Wine and Brandy Corporation.
Seven hundred and thirty eight million litres were exported, with wineries selling a large amount of bulk wine to reduce surplus stocks.

Cotton properties fail to sell
Two large multi-million dollar cotton properties in south west Queensland have failed to sell at auction.
The Queensland Government had planned to buy the farms to return water to the Murray Darling Basin, but withdrew because it did not have the support of the New South Wales or Federal Governments.
The properties, Clyde and Ballandool, with water licences totalling 58,000 megalitres were expected to make about $60 million at auction on Friday.
Ballandool was passed in at $20 million, while Clyde is still under negotiation at $27 million.
Ian Cush from the New South Wales Irrigators Association says the properties have little stored water and growers could not afford to invest and not have a return.

Code of conduct for pig welfare criticised
The animal rights group Voiceless has criticised the Federal Government's draft code of conduct for pig welfare, claiming it is inaccurate and limits public consultation.
Voiceless says the proposed code invites the public to make submissions through a survey which restricts objections to things like sow stalls.
Spokeswoman Katrina Sharman says the code also incorrectly claims other countries have no plans to phase out sow stalls, which is inhibiting public debate.
"The regulatory impact statement which accompanies the code suggests in Denmark, which is a major competitor to Australia's pig meat market, there are no plans to phase out sow stalls," she said.

Grain production forecasts down
Strong global wheat prices are the only bright spot for growers at the moment, with production forecasts down right around the country.
Queensland has all but given up on its winter wheat, it is a similar case in WA, while New South Wales and Victoria are doing it tough, with weeds the latest threat to young crops.
It is a gloomy picture right around the country, with South Australia the only state expected to deliver a reasonable harvest.
But grains analyst Lloyd George says with international stocks expected to tighten, good prices should continue.

Dry Seasons Advisory Committee activated
With Western Australia struggling through its driest start to winter on record, the State Government has activated its Dry Seasons Advisory Committee.
To be formed this week, the committee will include farm bodies, farm management consultants, rural business and local and state government.
Dexter Davies will again chair the committee, which last operated between 2000 and 2002, and says there are a range of areas to be addressed.
"Identify the worst areas, things like health services, the education services, all the basic services to make sure that we've got enough there and people have got somewhere to turn to very early in the piece," he said.

Chapman Valley victorious in Powder Puff footy match
When times are tough it is even more important to have a laugh and there were plenty on hand at the annual Powder Puff footy match in WA's Chapman Valley at the weekend.
The game pits the Valley girls against the Northampton girls in front of a bid crowd of local farmers.
Abbey Langley of Northampton kicked a ripper goal on the siren and explains how it all happened.
"One of our players high tackled a Chapman Valley girl and they went to kick it and I was just in the right spot at the right time," she said.
"And I marked it. I don't know how far I was out, but I thought I wasn't going to get it.
"But I thought I'd better have a crack at it on the siren. So yeah, it was pretty funny. It's good fun."

Organiser pleased with beef auction prices
Central Australian beef has attracted record prices at a weekend auction at the Alice Springs Show.
The champion steer carcass, from the Holt family of Delny Station, sold for $6.70 a kilogram.
Competition organiser Nicole Hayes says she was surprise that so many drought-hit pastoralists supported the auction.
"Considering the season, we are pleased with that," she said.
"We had to support it so you have sort of got to put in what you have got and considering how dry it is at home, it's good to see.
"We just haven't got the cattle that we would have had in previous years. Our numbers are going to be right down, especially for next year.
"There's not many little calves around which is a bit unfortunate but it's as good as we can do.

Apple growers take advantage of Italian World Cup win
Apple orchardists in central western New South Wales are already trying to take advantage of this morning's World Cup win by Italy.
Italian-born, but proud Australian orchardist Guy Gaeta says he is looking for white apples to blend with his fruit.
"We have got red and green apples I suppose but unfortunately we haven't got any white ones," he said.

Ship owners back moves for cheaper foreign workers
Ship owners say the latest move to replace Australian crew members with foreign workers is important for the competitiveness of our exports.
Crew members from the MV Stolt, currently docked in Hobart, are refusing to load the tanker in protest at plans to re-flag the vessel and replace them.
But Llew Russell from Shipping Australia Limited says it is cheaper to use foreign workers and the trend is likely to continue.
"We certainly support viable and competitive Australian flagged shipping but this should not be in terms of inhibiting our overseas competitiveness," he said.

Farm quarantined after BJD find
Just when many farmers in Western Australia thought the season could not get any worse, there has been confirmation of a fatal wasting disease in a cattle herd.
The Department of Agriculture and Food says a farm near Albany in the state's Great Southern, has been placed under quarantine, in a bid to prevent further spread of bovine Johne's disease (BJD).
The state's BJD-free status is now under threat.
Chief vet Dr Peter Buckman says an extensive testing process is now under way to try to trace beef cattle which have been sold off the farm in the past decade.

Mining company shares continue trading halt
Shares in Australian Mining Investment remain in a trading halt because of concerns over whether the company has disclosed enough information to the stockmarket.
The Queensland explorer shot from obscurity last week when its shares jumped 2,000 per cent after it discovered rich veins of copper at its Rocklands deposit near Cloncurry.
However, Hartley's resource expert Rob Brierley says the Australian Securities and Investment Commission is now querying whether the drill results meet market standards.

Govt urged to rework fuel tax bill
There are claims today that the Federal Government's complex fuel tax bill could spell the end of the biofuels industry.
The renewable fuel sector says investors are being turned away because the bill has reduced its access to the market since its introduction on July 1.
Bob Gordon from Renewable Fuels Australia says the Federal Government needs to go back to the drawing board to make the legislation fairer.
"Unlike the rest of the world which is surging ahead with biofuels industry growth and all of those countries that have emerging biofuel industries have high tariff regimes to protect them against imports until they're established in the market," he said.
"Australia is going in the opposite direction. Progress is going to freeze in Australia, if not worse."
A Victorian dairy company says with the a growing number of biofuel projects on the drawing board, companies will have to convince the Federal Government to offer tax incentives.
John McLean from the Warrnambool Cheese and Butter Factory says his company wants to use bio-gas from its cheesemaking operation as a dual fuel for its milk tankers.

VFF group calls for restructure
There are calls today for a major restructure of the Victorian Farmers Federation (VFF).
The VFF's livestock group says its membership has fallen from 6,000 to 3,000 and it may no longer be able to afford representation on peak industry bodies like the Sheepmeat Council.
Group president Ailsa Fox says the VFF needs to change the way it allocates its budget.
"There's two ways of dealing with this question, whilst we need more funds, our executive officer identified that there is perhaps resources that could be shared a lot better within the organisation," she said.

Sheep thefts may lead to more livestock truck checks
Police on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula say they may resort to checking every livestock truck on the region's roads after a growing number of sheep thefts.
About 1,200 sheep have been reported stolen this year, including 250 head from near Wudinna this week.
Senior-Sergeant Paul Roberts says all peninsula police stations have been alerted.
"It may well be that we want the staff to stop all stock crates that are moving throughout the local service area and along the highways," he said.

US wheat farmers sue AWB
Six American wheat farmers have launched a class action against AWB in the United States, claiming the wheat exporter's dealings in overseas markets damaged their own incomes.
According to media reports, the US wheat farmers are alleging AWB engaged in a global campaign of racketeering, money laundering, fraud and bribery.
While some of the allegations relate to the Iraq market, others relate to deals in Yemen, Pakistan and Indonesia.
The US farmers are arguing for millions of dollars in compensation, claiming AWB's actions resulted in them being excluded from certain wheat markets and damaged their economic interests.
But law Professor Richard Garnett says even if the action is successful, there are doubts about whether AWB in Australia could be financially liable.
"We don't generally recognise judgments from foreign countries which are punitive or designed to punish defendents, we only recognise judgments which are compensatory, where a sum of money is provided in compensation for losses," he said.
AWB, which has not yet been served with the writ, says the actions are ill conceived and the company will vigorously defend any claims.
Meanwhile the first shipment of 350,000 tonnes of grain through the Wheat Australia consortium is expected to set sail for Iraq this week.
But AWB International says if there is a new tender to supply Iraq it would prefer to strike the deal itself.
The Iraqi Grains Board has refused to deal with AWB because of its involvement in the oil-for-food scandal.
But AWB International chairman Ian Donges is hoping for a change of heart.
"We'll wait for that tender of course and we'll be talking to Iraq in terms of whether the ban still applies to AWB firstly," he said.

CSIRO begins researching grape quality potential
New equipment is being developed to measure the potential quality of grapes before they are harvested.
The CSIRO has been researching the links between grapes and the quality of the wine they produce, using chemical and sensory analysis.
It is hoped the research can be used to develop bio-sensor technology, which will be used to test grapes at the vineyard or weighbridge.
CSIRO scientist Dr Aggie Cox says that should help growers receive fairer prices.
"What we're basically trying to do is look for things that we can measure to be able to tell us what sort of wines those grapes can produce," he said.
"And the reason we're doing that is to try and make the wine a lot more consistent so the winemakers have some sort of idea of what that parcel of grape is potentially able to produce in the end.

Beekeepers discuss industry's future
Australia's leading beekeepers are in Launceston today discussing the challenges of falling honey prices and the growing threat of disease.
It is estimated that the beekeeping industry is worth $1.7 billion to Australian agriculture, and at today's meeting, apiarists from around the country are deciding how best to allocate the annual half-a-million-dollar research and development budget to protect the future of the industry.
Chief among concerns is the threat of the verroa mite, which has already decimated the US industry and was found in New Zealand's South Island just three weeks ago.

Mahogony timber harvest headed for floorboarding
The first commercial timber harvest from far north Western Australia is destined to be floorboarding for Perth's housing boom.
Indian sandalwood was supposed to be grown in the Ord River pilot project, but the trees were taken over by african mahogany, with 300 hectares now harvested.
Max Correy from the Kimberley Timber Company says the mahogany trees seem to enjoy the irrigated growing conditions.
"All the other mahogany plantations, which have more or less been trial plantations are all dry-land," he said.
"And of course they are looking at two to two and a half, maybe three times the growth time frame that we are.

Wwoofers on the increase in Aust
Australia now has the largest number of wwoofers in the world.
The term wwoofing stands for "willing workers on organic farms" where travellers help with farmwork in exchange for food and board.
Australia has around 11,000 wwoofers working on 1,600 farms each year.
Jordyn Rettinger, a 22-year-old from Ontario in Canada says it is a great way to see the world.

Fungi used in weed kill trials
Scientists are closer to understanding how native fungi can kill introduced weeds across northern Australia.
Trials in north Queensland have identified 10 varieties of fungi which have been causing dieback in parkinsonia, a weed which threatens 75 per cent of Australia's north.
Victor Galea from the University of Queensland says it is unusual to find a native organism that can be used as a cheap biological control agent.
"We suspect that a lot of these fungi which are in the soil are adapted to live in that situation and parkinsonia is not adapted so well," he said.

Wool price increases predicted
Some good news for the wool industry today, with analysts tipping good price increases in the second half of the year.
Retail demand is down in key markets like the United States and Japan, but economic conditions in most wool consuming countries are forecast to improve, which should see sales pick up.
With most Australian auction centres entering the winter recess, chief economist at Woolmark, Chris Wilcox, says confidence for the rest of the year is high.
"We would expect to see a similar price gain to what we've seen in the first six months," he said.
"It is a fairly positive outlook, in fact Woolmark business survey results, the last survey we did was the most positive we've seen in nearly five years. And I think we'll see more of that in the coming few months."
Meanwhile, the latest figures from Australian Wool Innovation show wool production is set to fall away in Western Australia by about 7 per cent over the next year, with a minor increase in the eastern states.
Although dry conditions are affecting most of the country, sheep numbers are not expected to decline any further.

Study shows more severe droughts ahead for Aust
New research into the sun suggests eastern Australia could face more severe droughts over the next 500 years.
A study at the University of New England in New South Wales has shown a link between solar cycles and rainfall patterns, which can be used in conjunction with the southern oscillation index to more accurately predict droughts.
Associate Professor Robert Baker says fewer sunspots or cold patches on the surface of the sun may mean the eastern states are headed for drier times in the long term.

Live export industry generating $1.8b a year
The live export industry is fighting back against animal rights activists with an industry backed survey released today detailing the part it plays in the national economy.
Live exports have been under attack from activists for some years and the Federal Government has banned exports to some Middle East countries following animal cruelty concerns.

Lamb exporter releases new contract conditions for producers
A major Western Australian lamb exporter admits it has taken a risky step by negotiating new contracts for the heavy lamb market in North America.
In recognition of the hard winter across the southern half of the state, meat marketing co-operative WAMMCO has released new contract conditions for producers, allowing for lambs two kilograms lighter.
Chief executive Des Griffiths says the main challenge is to help producers to continue selling their lambs, despite the lack of winter feed and also hold on to the lucrative export markets.
"In Western Australia particularly, we're at risk of losing it because in the eastern states if they have a reasonable season, the product is available out of there," he said.

US wheat futures jump
United States wheat futures jumped a further 3 per cent last night following growing concerns about their spring wheat crop.
Contracts on Chicago out until December 2008 have also jumped to nearly $US5.00 a bushel, well above the current spot price.
Dougal Hunter, from the Australian Stock Exchange, says this points to good domestic prices for the next three harvests.
"There's no doubt the higher prices out in the deferred months, particularly 2007 and 2008 for Chicago have presented selling opportunities both on swaps and on the ASX," he said.
"On the ASX at the moment the January contract for milling wheat settled at $218.

Cattlemen claim best season in years
Cattlemen south-west of Darwin are hailing their best season in years.
The heavy wet season has seen a growing number of cattle being fattened in the Douglas Daly region.
Producer Ian Mcbean says the conditions should see an increase in the number of cattle going into the territory's live export trade.
"It is definitely the best season I have ever seen in the 50 odd years I have been in the Territory, really good growing season," he said.

States look to align illegal fishing laws
Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory are looking at aligning their laws to tackle illegal fishing, as part of a joint effort to tackle the problem.
The Federal Government has also agreed to fund a pilot project, examining the role of Indigenous sea rangers in coastal surveillance.
But Peter Cassells, from International Fisheries, says ultimately there will not be a need for rangers to help because the Government wants to stop illegal fishermen before they reach Australian territorial waters.
"I mean in an ideal world illegal fishers will not get through to the coastal strips," he said.

Cherry growers urged to support levy increase
Cherry growers say they are facing a tough season, with a lack of overseas markets and a forecast heavy crop.
New fruit fly protocols in Taiwan have closed that market and growers cannot get fruit into China, the US or New Zealand.
The industry now wants to increase its levy from one to eight cents a kilogram to fund research and development, marketing and promotions.
Trevor Ranford from Cherry Growers Australia hopes most growers will support the changes.
Efforts have begun to tackle fruit fly outbreaks on a national basis for the first time.
In the past, controlling the pest has been left up the states, but the horticulture sector believes there needs to be a more coordinated approach.
Plant Health Australia spokesman Kyle Thoms says there will be a meeting in Canberra next month to kick off the effort.
"There's been a lot of good work done that's been done over many years across all of the states, but this is going to give us a chance, this national program, to bring all those players together," he said.

Conference to focus on sustainability of Indigenous communities
The future of remote Indigenous communities is in the spotlight at a national conference in Perth today.
Across Australia, 250 delegates will attend the conference to look at how to make the communities sustainable.
Doctor Martin Anda from Murdoch University says they will not be focusing on past failures, but looking for the success stories.
"[We will be] sharing ideas together on exactly how we might formulate some of these new ways forward to try bringing more life and sustainability to some of these far-flung communities," he said.

Kangaroo skin hits fashion capitals
Kangaroo skin is being promoted by designers and manufacturers in the fashion capitals of the world.
A company in Cairns which exports up to 18,000 skins every two months to processors in Spain, France and Italy says the skins are made into everything from clothing to footballs.
Exporter Ross Gates says the skin is proving popular because of its strength, repellent nature and pliability.
"Quite a number of the upmarket men's shoe manufacturers are starting to manufacturer their shoes from kangaroo," he said.

US researchers to grow crops on Mars
Researchers in the United States are running trials to see if crops can be grown on the planet Mars.
NASA plans to send astronauts to Mars to set up a planetary base, a mission which could last at least three years.
Researchers at the University of Florida are looking at which crops might be grown hydroponically on the shuttle during the trial and also in greenhouses on Mars to provide food for the astronauts.
Professor of food engineering Arthur Teixeira says results have been successful.
"I believe research is now available to show that we could probably rely on being able to grow certain varieties of rice, dry beans, soy beans and sweet potato," he said.

Mumbai train explosion behind gold price increase
The price of gold jumped $17 in New York overnight after a fatal train explosion ripped through the financial district of Mumbai in India.
Spot gold price settled at $US643.10 an ounce, $80 below its record high in May this year.

Instant TV messages to alert remote communities
If you are living in remote Australia in the future, instant messages with information from bushfire alerts to doctor visits could pop up on your television.
New research by the Desert Knowledge Cooperative Research Centre has shown that the TV is almost always switched on in remote communities and improved technology could make sure messages get through.
Dr Andrew Turk from Murdoch University says the technology would help to improve communication.
"From the results of our survey, TVs seem to be on pretty well all day, now whether people are watching them is another question," he said.
"But if we put a message as audio in Idigenous language, people pick up on that even if they're not watching the set and they realise that is something of interest to them, rather than just the general chatter in English.

Fuel prices changing rural lifestyles
High fuel prices are changing how rural families live, with some dropping children's sporting commitments and car pooling with neighbours.
The latest figures from the Bureau of Statistics show transport, food and groceries and recreation are the three biggest expenses for rural household budgets.
Queensland beef producer Georgie Somerset believes country people spend more on recreation because they are spending more time on the farm.
"Perhaps there's a sense there of 'well we'll go and do this while it's in town, or we'll take up the opportunity to go to a performance'," he said.
"If you're not going to get away from where you live then you may as well make the most of what you've got there and so yes I think there probably has been some more spending on things like a DVD machine and a decent TV because they're actually spending more weeks at home and less weeks away on holidays."
The New South Wales Irrigators Council says it will withdraw support for the National Water Initiative, unless the federal and state governments make radical changes.
The council's chief executive, Doug Miell, says the initiative is "off the rails" and will place a huge financial burden on farmers and rural communities.

PM asked to slow down water trading
Farmers in Victoria's Goulburn Valley have called on the Prime Minister to slow down the pace of water trading in order to stop it destroying local farms.
The Parliamentary Secretary responsible for water, Malcolm Turnbull, has met farmers in Shepparton.
They have told him they cannot compete for local water which is being sent down the Murray to irrigate vineyards and almond farms, and that they enjoy tax breaks through managed investment schemes (MIS).
Mr Turnbull says he will raise the issue with Mr Howard.
"I'll take back to the PM the concern that there is in the community, that the managed investment schemes have certain tax advantages," he said.

Rural property values plateau
Rural property values seem to have finally plateaued after rising by 70 per cent over the past five years.
Elders rural property expert John Peden says the softer market is more a correction than a direct result of drought or lower farm incomes.
With uncertainty over water allocations, Mr Peden says there is less confidence in the irrigation sector, although the beef industry continues to boom.
"There is normally a slowing in sales volume during the winter. We are experiencing that at the present time, possibly a little more than in previous years," he said.

Drought relief scheme extended
There is good news today for 25 per cent of drought-hit farmers who rely on off-farm work to maintain an income.
Last year the Federal Government relaxed aid rules, allowing primary producers to earn up to $41,000 without affecting their drought relief payments.

Mining company confident of copper deposit discovery
The directors of mining company, CuDeco, remain confident they have found one of Australia's biggest deposits of copper near Cloncurry in north-west Queensland.
The company, which until yesterday was known as Australian Mining Investments, hit the headlines after its share price jumped from 29 cents to a high of $10 in seven weeks.
Trading in shares are suspended pending an investigation by the Australian Stock Exchange.
Directors met to reassure more than 30 shareholders in Cloncurry yesterday about the accuracy of the company's exploration results.
CuDeco chairman Wayne McCrae thinks they are sitting on something big.
"We'll put a resource out of 59 million tonnes at 2 per cent and all the indications are [that] it just seems to be getting bigger," he said.

Wool quality and production on agenda of merino conference
Around 900 delegates from across the globe are in Perth today for the World Merino Conference.
Western Australian Farmers Federation spokesman Mike Norton says the latest developments in breeding and innovation, as well as wool quality and production, are on the agenda.
He says it is excellent news to have so many people from around the world to attend a conference in Western Australia.
"You really do get a different perspective of your industry from the speakers as they come around the world on what's happening," he said.

Frost damage blamed for drop in orange crop
South Australia's navel orange crop will be down by as much as 30,000 tonnes due to frost damage.
Industry officials say the crop could come in at between just 45,000 and 50,000 tonnes.
Other varieties including mandarins, lemons, tangelos and grape fruit have also suffered significant losses.
Citrus Crop Estimates Committee spokesman Kym Thiel says more damage could still appear.
"For some individuals there may be 100 per cent loss, for others it may only be a certain percentage," he said.

Italian company doubles Aust wool purchases
The wool industry is claiming a win, following news that Italian fashion giant Benetton will double its purchase of Australian wool over the next two years.
Last year, animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ended a nine month campaign to pressure Benetton to boycott Australian wool, over its concerns about the practice of mulesing.

Ad blitz to counteract animal liberation group campaigns
Australia's peak livestock body is planning a national advertisting blitz to try to counter campaigns against the live export trade being run by animal liberation groups.
Meat and Livestock Australia says consumer attitudes to animal welfare are one of the biggest challenges facing the industry.
Meat and Livestock's chairman Don Heatley says the campaign, which is already running in Western Australia, explains how exporters are trying to improve welfare conditions for livestock.
"We intend over a period of time leading up over the next six months to actually roll that out on a national basis across Australia, so that the community understands what we do," he said.

Toxic weed could cost Qld millions
A new survey of a toxic weed is expected to show it is costing the Queensland livestock sector tens of millions of dollars in stock losses.
Agforce and the Department of Primary Industries have just launched a landholder survey of pimelea which has resurged because of dry conditions in the western Darling Downs.
The survey will be used to attact research funding to help landholders who do not have any way of curing affected stock.

Investment needed to control buffel grass: expert
Control of the introduced pasture buffel grass is proving a major challenge across central Australian parks.
For the past 12 years, Sydney University students have assisted Finke Gorge National Park rangers, south-west of Alice Springs.
The control work involves hot fires and a new soil sterilant.
An anonymous trust funds the majority of the work, but Professor Lester Burgess from the Faculty of Agriculture says there needs to be continual investment.
The overall program costs $10,000 each year.
"The buffel grass is continuing to increase slowly overall in the park, but I think we have been quite successful in slowing it in some areas, no more than about 50 hectares and we have reasonably good control over a further 250 to 500 hectares," he said.

Coal project to speed up approval
A new coal project in central Queensland will receive help to speed up the Federal Government approval process.
The Sonoma Coal Project near Collinsville has been elevated to national significance status, which means government agencies will provide support to cut down red tape.

Fruit picking not for everyone, says grower
Single parents, the long-term unemployed, older people and some disability pensioners could all be forced to pick fruit under the Federal Government's new welfare-to-work program.
Under the guidelines, anyone living within 90 minutes of a harvest area can be eligible for fruit picking.
Victorian grower Michael Tripodi says extra workers are welcome, but not everyone is cut out for the job.
"To come out on an orchard we have to see value for money in our employees also. It's a bit hard for us to put someone on that won't work as hard as we expect them to work," he said.
"We're starting at daybreak and we'll probably try and push through until two o'clock, once it gets to 40, 42-43 degrees it's bloody hot up here.

Stakeholders discuss quarantine concerns
A top-level meeting is today discussing how Australia's quarantine system can be improved.
About 60 government and industry delegates have gathered in Canberra to examine a range of concerns.
The National Farmers Federation (NFF), which is facilitating the meeting, says the relationship between AQIS and Biosecurity Australia could be improved to ensure Australia's competitive advantage in agriculture.
While some stakeholders such as the New South Wales Farmers Association have expressed a need to combine the two quarantine authorities, NFF president David Crombie says that is unnecessary.
"I think the really important thing is to make sure that we have the right people sitting around the table when we're putting probabilities on the likelihood of occurrence and we have the right people sitting around the table - and I include industry in that - of assessing what the likely consequence is," he said.
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says the Federal Government has dropped its defences to ensure an open and frank assessment of the system.
"It will be a free-wheeling discussion and there will be different points of view because not all of the many organisations present share entirely the same approach," he said.

European snail found in Launceston
A European snail has been found in Australia, discovered on the outside of grain containers in Launceston in northern Tasmania.
Known as white snails, they arrived on containers of lupins from Western Australia.
Danny Reardon from Quarantine Tasmania says the situation was dealt with quickly and he defends quarantine officers at the port of Fremantle, through which the snails apparently passed undetected.
"When you come to think about it, there's hundreds of thousands of containers coming into the country and there's always a possibility that things will get through the barrier," he said.
"It all depends on what stage the snails were at when they come in. They could've been in the form of eggs, they may not have been developed, they could have developed during the storage process there.

Scant rainfall dashes farmers' hopes
A forecast of heavy rain has ended in disappointment for South Australia's northern pastoralists.
The weather bureau was predicting falls of up to 40 millimetres in some parts, but most properties got less than 20.
Tony Williams from Mt Barry Station near Oodnadatta says it was an anti-climax.
"There was a big build up to this one ... but it was a bit of fizzer, there were good falls north of Oodnadatta, handy falls, but south down our way we only had nine millimetres - so very disappointing, really," he said.
"It's been eight months since we've had a decent fall.
"Around 30 millimetres would have been nice but maybe next time."
Meanwhile, grain farmers in north-west Victoria are hoping the weather bureau's prediction of rain this weekend is accurate.
There is no subsoil moisture on some farms at Ouyen, some farmers have given up on sowing crops, while others have significantly revised their plans.
Farmer Dean Munro is not sure what is in store for the crop he planted eight weeks ago.
"The stuff that we did sow only about 20 or 30 per cent has actually come up, the rest of it is still in the ground, things are looking pretty grim," he said.
"This weekend's probably the last roll of the dice for this crop I'd say.
"If we don't get substantial rain this weekend it's certainly in a fair bit of trouble."
But pastoralists in the Northern Territory have fared much better.
Every district received falls in the past 24 hours.
In the Alice Springs district, most communities and stations received between 10 and 20 millimetres, with 54 millimetres recorded at Hamilton Downs Station.

Uranium drilling draws positive results
Australia's next uranium mine could be north-west of Alice Springs in central Australia.
Deep Yellow, a Western Australian uranium exploration company, released positive results this week from its exploration drilling at Napperby Station, 150 kilometres from Alice Springs.
Stockbroker Matthew Baker says that at just under half a pound per tonne reported it could be economic.
"It's still very early stage but if you're looking at uranium companies, to me the angle is quite simple," he said.
"You look at them and say 'well I want one in the Territory because it doesn't matter what the Government here says'.

ASX investigates junior mining company
A second junior mining company, Frontier Resources, has come under the scrutiny of the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) after it released exploration results that doubled its share price.
Shares in Queensland copper explorer Cudeco remain in a trading halt, pending an investigation into drill results.
One of the caveats on explorers releasing information to the market is that results must meet the standards of the joint ore reserve code.
Don Larkin, from the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, says geologists can be suspended for releasing misleading results to shareholders.
"If there is a breach of the code or if there is some questions on the code the ASX will ask questions behind the scenes," he said.

Wool estimates 'ambitious'
Elders national manager of wool says wool production forecasts released this week are overly ambitious.
Australian WooI Innovation has predicted shorn wool production in Australia to stay relatively stable in the coming year, with production tipped to increase slightly in the eastern states, but fall in Western Australia.

Dam task force chief meets locals
Former Queensland governor Major General Peter Arnison has begun meetings and inspections as head of south-east Queensland's dam task force.
Plans for a dam in the Mary Valley, south of Gympie, will see more than 500 properties resumed and a smaller dam has been proposed for Wyaralong on the Logan River.
Visiting the Mary River site yesterday, Maj Gen Arnison listened to local concerns and was open to having more people on the task orce.
"We're about trying to get the broadest possible understanding of what the issues are," he said.
"I think in terms of the second phase of this which is looking for a much better, brighter economic and social future for the Mary Valley and Cooloola Shire.

SAFF sells building to pay debts
The South Australian Farmers Federation (SAFF) is putting its Adelaide headquarters on the market to try to pay off its debts.
SAFF has been in financial strife for a number of years and falling membership numbers have made it difficult to stay afloat.
General manager Carol Vincent says the sale of the building will put SAFF back on track.
"The sale of the building will fix the whole thing, it'll pay off the debt," she said.
"They'll have enough money to buy another building and a number of hundreds of thousands of dollars left to invest in whatever way they see fit to give them reserves.

NT banana growers cashing in on prices
Banana growers in the Northern Territory are continuing to receive record prices following the destruction of major plantations by cyclone Larry.
The Territory's largest grower also operates in north Queensland and the Darwin farm has been a lifeline for the business.
Farm manager Mark Smith says the Territory still has the cheapest bananas in the nation.
"Up until the cyclone we would lose money sending fruit down south. The local market has kept us afloat," he said.
"The cheapest bananas in Australia are in Darwin at the moment, so it looks like the prices are up at around $15 per kilogram elsewhere in the southern states.

Olive leaves show cancer-killing potential
Laboratory tests of an extract from olive leaves have shown it can kill prostate and breast cancer cells.
Southern Cross University researchers on the north coast of New South Wales completed the work for a manufacturer of the extract.
The university's Dr Lesley Stevensen says the results sound remarkable, but need to be considered in context.
She says clinical trials are needed to test the lab theory.
"The effects that we found were lethal in that they would actually kill the cells if you like," she said.

Science in the paddock wins award for school
An isolated high school in north-west Tasmania has gained national recognition for taking science classes to the farm paddock.
Smithton High beat 22 other entries to win this year's Australian Rural Education Award.
Science students tested local soil and water quality and then reported back to local wool company Woolnorth.
Assistant principal Susan Wigg says local farmers are now lining up for help from the students.
"We are most certainly thrilled to win the award and I'm sure that the community will be proud that we have won this award," she said.

Toowoomba ratepayers to vote on drinking recycled water
As the water crisis in south-east Queensland continues, the ratepayers of Toowoomba will vote on whether they are prepared to drink recycled water.
Toowoomba Mayor Di Thorley says the referendum is the first of its type and is a condition of Commonwealth funding.
"It was not our idea I can assure you," she said.

AWB seeks to confidential protect documents
Monopoly wheat exporter AWB is trying to stop the oil-for-food inquiry accessing more than 1,300 confidential documents it says are protected by legal privilege.
Barrister Melissa Perry told the Federal Court AWB's privilege claim has risen since May, when it first submitted its list of secret documents.
AWB is arguing that the new amendment to the Royal Commissions Act allowing Commissioner Terence Cole to inspect the confidential documents is unconstitutional and will cause the head of the Cole Inquiry to be in contempt if he examines them.

Rural health professions hail agreement
Rural health professionals say a new agreement between the states and the Federal Government will go a long way towards fixing the shortage of doctors in country areas.
An extra 200 medical school places, funding for rural medical schools and a new system of training that includes stints in regional areas are just some of the proposals put forward.
Rural medicine will be recognised in its own right and there will be a national action plan for mental health.
Head of Melbourne University's rural medical school, Dawn deWitt, says while getting extra student places is a great achievement the hard work now is getting the teachers.
"How we are going to work through this issue of asking an already short workforce to teach a huge number of additional new students is going to be the trick," she said.
The Rural Doctors Association says it is not clear how many of the new medical school places will be bonded but it hopes they will include living allowances and other incentives.

Russia to open up beef export market
Russia will open up its beef export market to international bidders due to a shortage of beef from the European Union.
About 230,000 tonnes of beef is needed to fill the Russian quota, with Brazil and Australia considered to be the big contenders.
Prices for beef in Russia have jumped 40 per cent since the beginning of the year.
Andrew MacCallum from Meat and Livestock Australia says it is a significant new market and should keep international beef prices buoyant.

7th mad cow disease case detected in Canada
The seventh case of BSE or mad cow disease has been detected in Canada.

NZ butter suspended from Europe
The world dairy market looks set to further weaken after the suspension of New Zealand butter from Europe.
The European Court of Justice made the ruling after a German company challenged New Zealand's import licence.
New Zealand's exports to Europe make up about 15 per cent of the total world butter trade.
Rabobank dairy analyst Tim Hunt says Australian farmers will feel the effects.
"Fonterra and the New Zealand Government are working hard to reverse the decision but if the issue is not resolved and trade resumed within four to six months we're going to have a lot of butter looking for a new home on the global market," he said.

Name change for sherry, port labels
Australia's wine industry will no longer use sherry or port on their labels to try to gain better access to the European market.
Under an agreement to phase out the use of traditional European wine terms, port will become Australian tawny, while vintage port will be known as Australian vintage.
Sam Tolley from the Wine and Brandy Corporation says it will mean more freedom.
"We've been able to use this as a bargaining chip to get better access to the marketplace," he said.

Pulp mill integrated impact statement released
Timber company Gunns has released an integrated impact statement for its proposed pulp mill at Bells Bay in northern Tasmania.
The company says the $1.4 billion project will create 4,000 jobs during construction and add hundreds of millions of dollars to the value of export woodchips.
Environmental groups are worried the mill could result in more logging in native forests, although that has been rejected by project manager Les Baker.
"Not one tree will be cut down or one tree planted as a result of this project," he said.
"It simply transfers 60 per cent of Gunns export chips [that otherwise go to Asia] where its value added to a pulp mill in Tasmania.
"Woodchips are sold for about $90 a tonne where as pulp is sold for approximately $800 a tonne so it's a terrific value adding project."

Indigenous communities urged to take better care of dogs
With animal numbers on the rise in remote communities, Indigenous communities are being urged to take better care of their dogs to help improve their own health.
A national dog conference in Darwin today is trying to unite Indigenous families and reduce livestock losses.
Community leaders, vets and health workers have come together to share ideas, including the development of shared responsibility agreements to attract funding.
Dr Mark Lawrie from the RSPCA says that might help in a range of ways.
"I guess there's another over-arching thing that we're looking at at this conference too and that's the concept of the linkage between violence to animals and people," he said.

Giant pumpkins attract tourists
Giant pumpkins were a major attraction at the weekend's Kununurra Agricultural Show in Western Australia's far north.
Just under 5,000 people came to see the Ord Valley's produce, including tourists travelling across Australia's north.
Two pumpkins tied for the title as the show's biggest, weighing in at 55.9 kilograms.
The oversized vegetables caught most by surprise, including Gumi from Osaka, Japan.

Rain band saves crops in south-east
There are plenty of smiles over south-eastern Australia today after the first decent rain in months.
A big band of rain from central Queensland to southern Victoria has saved crops and put some water back in tanks and dams.

NSW
Farmers in the central cropping belt of New South Wales had a short-term reprieve, with falls of between 20 and 30 millimetres ensuring the survival of winter wheat crops.
But the best falls were in the northern and far western regions, with the top total of 60 millimetres recorded at Louth, west of Bourke.
Local grazier Wally Mitchell says it is great.
"This has been a magnificent rain change. Many of us have been pushing scrub, feeding cotton seed, keeping our breeders alive and some of us had even had a big punt, and joined, so the little lambs are just coming on the ground here and this will really turn the job around for us," he said.
Parts of Victoria were luckier than others, with talkback callers to the ABC reporting falls of up to 60 millimetres in the state's north.

SA
In South Australia, widespread rain is expected to keep the state's harvest on track for a bumper season.
The top readings was at Maralinga in the far west with 65 millimetres, but while most farmers are saying it is the most significant rain they've received all year, others missed out.
Rodney Lush from Coombe in the upper south-east was pinning his hopes on a good rain after suffering a dry June and heavy frosts.
"It hasn't been heavy rain, it's barely been drizzle a lot of the time, it's only made things damp, it certainly hasn't wetted things, barely enough to get my pasture growth going again and it's certainly not enough let us go sowing lucerne with any confidence," he said.

Qld
In Queensland there were some good falls in the parched west and south-west, but little rain fell in the south-east, where dam levels are at critical levels.
Quilpie grazier Brian Rutledge says the 60 millimetres in his rain gauge is the best in six years.
But Mr Rutledge says much more is needed if the region is to recover from drought and lose its title of "heartbreak corner".
"It has been dubbed heartbreak corner in the years gone by and it is certainly living up to its name," he said.

AWEX in backflip on auction room decision
Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX) has reversed its decision to give up its auction rooms in Sydney and Melbourne.
AWEX had wanted wool brokers to take over the Yennora and Brooklyn sites by the end of the year.
The move was not supported by exporters or Sydney-based brokers, but Melbourne broker Don Fraser says it was vital to keep the auction rooms open.
"Our focus is on ensuring that our clients have a continuous selling arrangement for their wool," he said.
"Should AWEX have decided not to go ahead, we would then have taken the lease back after all the brokers did set up 691 Geelong Road.
"The arrangement will be as it has been in the past, which is a one year lease with a one year option."

Copper explorer's shares halved
Investors stripped almost $200 million from the value of Queensland copper explorer Cudeco Limited yesterday after it reclassified the size of its Rocklands deposits near Cloncurry.
The company was held in a trading halt for 12 days while the Australian Stock Exchange queried initial exploration work details released to the market.
Yesterday Cudeco was forced to halve the size of the deposit because original estimates did not follow market standards.
Shares in Cudeco, formerly known as Australian Mining Investments, were also slashed by half, finishing yesterday's trade at $3.56.
Hartley's resource expert Rob Brierley says it is a timely warning for shareholders in speculative exploration stocks.
"Certainly it's a touch of reality for Australian Mining Investments, it obviously got a little bit over excited," Mr Brierley said.
"It's by no means the end of the road, but it's probably a little lesson that sometimes you need to prove these things up in a little more detail."
A number of investors in Cudeco have contacted law firm Slater and Gordon about their losses.

Farmers set to be compensated for vitamin price fixing
Eligible farmers, feedlotters and feed suppliers are set to be compensated over the vitamin price fixing scandal of the 1990s.
Australia's first class action against a price fixing cartel has been settled with three major pharmaceutical companies agreeing to pay more than $30 million in compensation and more than $10 million in legal fees.
The settlement still needs to be endorsed by the Federal Court.
Lawyer Kim Parker from Maurice Blackburn Cashman says it is a breakthrough case.
"It was issued as a result of a global cartel being exposed in relation to vitamin products manufactured by a number of different vitamin, pharmaceutical companies including Roche, BASF and Aventis," Ms Parker said.

Banana industry expected to regain full strength by Xmas
Bananas from trees which escaped the full force of cyclone Larry in north Queensland earlier this year will begin arriving on supermarket shelves as early as September.
The price of the fruit has skyrocketed with most of the crop wiped out during the cyclone.
Craig Allen from the Banana Industry Promotions Company expects the industry to be back to full strength by Christmas.
"The response to the news has been great because banana ticket prices have been at absolute record levels," Mr Allen said.

Looming lettuce shortage prompts grower to buy new farm
With a looming shortage of lettuces due to water restrictions near Melbourne, one of Australia's largest growers has been forced to buy land in another part of Victoria.
Water allocations have been severely slashed in the Bacchus Marsh district due to low storage levels.
Frank Ruffo from National Fresh Salads has now bought a farm near Swan Hill, on the Murray River, to obtain more secure water allocations.
"This is probably the first time in history that Bacchus Marsh has been so severely hit, prior to that we haven't really had a great problem with water," Mr Ruffo said.

Tuna industry welcomes poaching report
A report that Japanese fishermen may have illegally caught more than $5 billion in tuna over the past 20 years has been welcomed by the Australian industry.
The report by the International Commission for the Conservation of Bluefin Tuna found that about 8,500 tonnes of tuna are being poached each year.
Brian Jeffriess from the Tuna Boat Owners Association says while illegal fishing has cost them income, the figures show there is more tuna in the wild than previously thought.
"That's a large loss of income over the last 20 years, if the report is correct," Mr Jeffriess said.
"That's a worrying situation.
"Strangely enough, if indeed it's true, then it shows the stock in a much stronger condition.
"The way the science works is in fact that the more that has been caught, the more productive the stock is.

WTO makes last effort to save trade talks
A last ditch effort has begun at the G8 summit in St Petersburg to save the Doha round of world trade talks.
World Trade Organisation (WTO) director-general Pascal Lamy has been in confidential talks with key countries including Australia, the United States and the European Union to discover their final positions on farm trade reform.

Sleeping disorders among mining workers on the rise
With the Western Australian mining industry continuing to boom, the number of shift workers suffering sleep disorders is growing.
Mining companies are operating 24 hours a day and the experts say many workers do not get enough sleep between shifts.
Dr David Hillman, from the Sir Charles Gardiner Hospital in Perth, says he is treating a large number of shift workers and there are safety concerns which must be addressed by mining companies.
"First of all there's a decrease in alertness levels, secondly our reaction times get slower," Dr Hillman said.
"Mood and memory are adversely affected, it just makes us under perform so we become safety risks amongst other things.
"It really is a massive issue for the Pilbara.

Hay balers fail to meet safety standards: survey
It is farm safety week and hay balers are the latest equipment to come in for some attention.
A recent survey by the Kondinin Group found two commonly-used hay balers failed to meet industry safety requirements.
Engineer Josh Guimelli says farmers should be wary when purchasing new equipment.
"A couple of the machines actually didn't have an upper walkway railing which, on a baler - large square baler - is quite a mission because they're rather high off the ground," Mr Guimelli said.

Researchers developing vaccine for de-sexing dogs
De-sexing dogs in the future may just involve a quick vaccination.
Researchers are developing non-surgical ways to control breeding without surgery.
Professor Henry Baker from Auburn University, in the United States, is visiting Australia and believes the emerging technology could help solve animal problems in remote Indigenous communities.
"[It involves] chemical sterilisation, injections into the reproductive organs to cause their destruction and vaccines," Professor Baker said.
"Most people think of vaccines with respect to controlling infectious diseases, but now vaccines have a new role to treat non-infectious diseases.
"In my country direct injection into the testes of dogs [is showing the most promise].
"That's a registered product.

Court decision looms over AWB documents case
Wheat exporter AWB will know this afternoon if the Federal Court will hear its case to keep 1,300 secret documents from the oil-for-food inquiry.
The company has claimed legal privilege over the material, saying it represents confidential advice and should not be seen by Commissioner Terence Cole.
AWB claims disclosure of over 1,300 documents will expose the company to irreparable harm, even though the Federal Government amended legislation last month giving Commissioner Cole the power to see the secret material.
AWB says the new law is unconstitutional and Commissioner Cole will be in contempt if he uses it.
The wheat exporter wants the Federal Court to impose a permanent injunction restraining the Commissioner from inspecting the documents.
Justice Neil Young will decide this afternoon if the court will intervene to hear the matter.
Meanwhile farmers in New South Wales have voted to continue their support for the single desk for wheat exports after a vigorous debate.
With the findings of the Cole inquiry into AWB still pending, farmers stated their support for the single desk while calling for better controls.
A motion was carried calling for improved corporate governance within AWB and better transparency between AWB and its export arm AWB International.

Nut growers look to overseas markets
Macadamia nut growers are looking offshore for markets for their near record production levels.
With falling consumer demand here in Australia, growers are taking advantage of reduced tariffs for value-added products which were introduced as part of the United States Free Trade Agreement.
Jim Twentyman from Suncoast Gold Macadamias in south-east Queensland says tariffs will be reduced to zero by 2008.
"At the moment, because of the duty reason, we're having to have that packed and processed in the USA so we believe from next year we'll be able to do the packaging and processing in Australia," he said.

Dried fruits industry to take on snack foods sector
The dried fruit industry says it will tackle the snack foods market in an effort to counter the growing competition from cheap imports.
Growers and processors say they cannot compete with the cost of production in Turkey and Iran to supply the lower end of the market.
Peter Jones from the Australian Dried Fruits Association says it is tough to get space on the supermarket shelves, but there is consumer demand for healthier alternatives to chocolate bars and chips.
"Traditionally we've always been looked at as being an ingredient in fruit cakes and breakfast cereals, so really we've got to go to the snacking market," he said.

Australia bags rice deal to supply South Korea
Australia has negotiated a deal to supply rice to South Korea.
The quota is for more than 9,000 tonnes of white rice each year for the next decade.

Sheep producers urged to make 'bare bum' check
Sheep producers are being urged to check for signs of 'bare bum' sheep in their flocks, because new research shows the trait is more widespread than first thought.
The condition, where the breech of the animal is bare of wool and has less wrinkles than other merinos, was found on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula last year.
Australian Wool Innovation has been researching the trait to find out if it can be passed on, and whether it could be an alternative to mulesing.
Head of sheep productivity, Dr Troy Fischer, says the sheep may also produce better wool.
"Like with any trait there's variation involved, but [it] essentially demonstrates there is potential to select for improved wool quality plus the bare breech trait," he said.

Court to hear AWB push to keep documents secret
The Federal Court has agreed to hear AWB's bid to keep 1,300 documents secret from the oil for food inquiry.

'Shear' hard work pays off for Aussies in Canada
Australia has beaten the world at an international sheep shearing competition at the Calgary Stampede in Alberta, Canada.
The Australian team of Rob Glover, from Bothwell in Tasmania and Jason Wingfield, from Victoria, beat New Zealand, the United States and Canada in a test match series over two days at Canada's biggest agricultural show, which attracts more than 1.3 million people.
Mr Glover said it was great to get a win over the highly favoured Kiwis.

Farm group rethinks GM crops ban support
The New South Wales Farmers Association has withdrawn its support for a ban on genetically modified (GM) crops.
The association has passed a motion asking for the immediate lifting of the state's moratorium on GM crops.
Grain producer Michael Matthews says it is a victory for progressive farmers.
"This is a technology that we have to have to be able to compete on the world stage. Without this technology we're going to be sinking further and further behind," he said.
"This technology is all about producing greener crops, cleaner crops, healthier crops, crops grown with 70 per cent less herbicide and are more friendly to our environment.

Councils say water initiative hurting rates revenue
New South Wales local councils say they are facing a dramatic drop in rates revenue as a result of the National Water Initiative.
Under the water reform process, land and water titles are being separated which is expected to cause a drop in rates for irrigated land.
Councils now have to come up with a new rating formula to make up the difference.
The Nationals' Member for Murrumbidgee, Adrian Piccoli, is calling on the State Government to give councils more time and more help to make the changes.
"The Victorian Government has postponed the implementation of these new council rating structures by two years," he said.

Tradefresh launches takeover bid for Chiquita
A takeover bid has been launched for fresh fruit and vegetable company Chiquita Brands South Pacific.
The bid has been launched by Tradefresh, a company owned by agribusiness giant Timbercorp and the Costa Group, with an offer of 73 cents a share.
Market analyst Toby Grimm says the company's shares have traded much higher, but have experienced a slump over recent weeks.

Foreign buyers warn Australian sheep too expensive
Overseas buyers of live sheep are complaining that Australian livestock prices are too high.
In the Middle East, importers are warning that live sheep from countries like Somalia and India are constantly undercutting Australian mutton in the marketplace.
Jasem Al Dhahi from the Emirates Livestock and Meat Trading Company in Dubai says the price of Australian sheep has jumped four times in the past month, and his customers are looking elsewhere.
"In the last four ships now, the prices get high, high, high," he said.
"I cannot in the future buy more sheep from Australia. In the past maybe I buy 15,000, the next ship I will say send me 7,000."
Meanwhile, another shipload of Australian live sheep has just been unloaded at the port of Jebel Ali, near Dubai.
About 12,000 are now being held at one of the Middle East's most modern feedlots.
The feedlot is one of the most advanced facilities of its type in the Middle East.
The conditions are extremely hot at 50 degrees in the sun, but under the 34 hectares of shadecloth it is a more respectable 45 degrees Celcius.
When full, the housing facility can accommodate about 90,000 Australian sheep.
The most recent shipment arrive after a 16-day journey from Fremantle, with no evidence of foot soreness or too much heat stress, and are fed water that is specially cooled by big refrigeration units.

Transport industry fears higher fuel costs amid Mid East crisis
The transport sector is bracing for even higher fuel prices, as a result of the escalating crisis in the Middle East.
Analysts say it is only a matter of time before crude oil hits $US100 a barrel, leading to bowser prices of about $2 a litre.
Luke Fraser from the Livestock Transporters Association says trucking operators are already finding it hard to break even, and they will have to pass on the increased costs, with flow-on affects for the farming and export sectors.
"It is going to be difficult, but I think that more than that it is probably going to affect the whole meat and livestock chain and indeed grains and anything else that is being carried in the bush," he said.

Pork supplier plays down hepatitis A concerns
One of the country's largest pork suppliers says there is little risk of its customers contracting hepatitis A, despite one of its staff falling ill from the virus earlier this month.
Toowoomba-based company KR Castlemaine Foods, in southern Queensland, is today advertising product recall notices in all national newspapers.
Over the next two days KR Castlemaine is recalling 6,000 cartons of product from across Australia.
The president of parent company Darling Downs Foods, Mike Adams, says the staff member has recovered from the potentially fatal virus, which she contracted from a friend visiting from overseas.
"Queensland Health has said that there is nothing wrong with any of the systems or any of the ways we manufacture or produce the product," he said.
The recall will see 17 lines of ready-to-eat products including shaved and sliced ham turkey and chicken replaced, and is expected to cost the company $500,000.

Bagasse project's potential excites mill manager
Yesterday morning you might have heard Gordon Edwards talking about his plans to process and then sell Bagasse from the Mossman Mill to buyers in Japan.
Mr Edward's company Kristevefourspace has formed a joint venture with the mill and the plan is to sell bagasse fibre as a healthy food additive.
He says there is a strong demand for bagasse because the Japanese Government is pushing for an increased fibre content in school children's lunches.
Mr Edwards says if everything goes according to plan they should produce about $17.5 million worth of bagasse fibre.
"We currently have a joint venture agreement with the mill where we pay for all consumables with a percentage of gross on top so the mill can't lose out," he said.
"The value of bagasse powder compared to raw sugar is ten to one.
"Basically 40-50 cents for raw sugar, $5 a kilo for bagasse powder."
He says one processing machine has already been installed at the mill and soon three more will be in place.
Mossman Mill manager Alan Johnstone says he is excited about the bagasse project's potential because the technology has already been trialed in Okinawa and he hopes the Mossman trial proves equally successful.
Mr Johnstone says so far only a memorandum of understanding has been signed between the mill and Kristevefourspace and nothing is in writing regarding the breakdown of future profits.

Timbercorp, Costas launch Chiquita takeover bid
Agri-investment company Timbercorp has announced it is involved in a take-over bid for mushroom and fruit marketing company Chiquita Brands South Pacific.
For the bid, Timbercorp has joined forces with the Costa family to form a company called Tradefresh, which has offered 73 cents per share to buy out Chiquita.
The Costa group already owns 26 per cent of Chiquita shares.
If the bid is successful Timbercorp would end up with a 35 per cent share in Chiquita and the Costa family the remaining 65 per cent.
Bananas only represent about 15 per cent of Chiquita's normal annual turnover and before cyclone Larry the company marketed about 12 per cent of all bananas sold in Australia.
Mushrooms are Chiquita's biggest commodity making up about 35 to 40 per cent of its annual turnover, some from the Stanthorpe area in south-east Queensland.
Chiquita managing director Mano Babiolakis says he has only just heard about this takeover bid so he has advised shareholders not to take any action until it has been carefully assessed.
Timbercorp is a specialist investment management company involved in the Australian horticulture and forestry industries.
Timbercorp's deputy CEO Sol Rabinowicz believes Chiquita would be a sensible addition to their portfolio.
"Both we and Costas believe that there's an opportunity to join together the strength of the Costa group as one of Australia's leaders in fresh produce, farm management, packing, processing and marketing together with Chiquita's strengths as a category manager particularly in the area like berries, mushrooms and citrus," he said.
"We think that it can sit together, they can become a more efficient operator."

Cape York Peninsula: the ideal training ground?
Some Cape York Peninsula cattle producers believe far north Queensland properties offer the ideal training ground for young trainees into the industry and they are appealing to the Government to support some sort of subsidised training scheme.
The big side benefit would be properties could access much needed workers for dry season mustering.
Yesterday Greg Jenkins, from Strathburn Station, brought up the problem of workers and how hard it is to recruit young people to cattle properties in far north Queensland.
The problem is young people can earn more money elsewhere and compared to previous generations, Mr Jenkins believes the youth of today are less inclined to work in remote areas.
Jay Willmann's family runs Yarraden station near Coen but they have only been there three years after coming up from central Queensland.
Mr Willmann says on Cape York Peninsula properties the work is intense, varied and exciting so young people learn the ropes a lot quicker than down south.
"I worked in central Queensland a lot, all over stations," he said.
"The biggest thing is they didn't have the variety of work that we have up here.

Farmers welcome EC assistance extension
Farmers across four states have welcomed the Federal Government's decision to extend drought relief until next year.
Exceptional circumstances (EC) have been extended in 23 drought-declared areas in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.
Under the scheme, farmers and pastoralists who are been battling drought receive income and business support.
Tiffany Lord, from Yudnapinna Station west of Port Augusta in South Australia, says it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the assistance.
"It's helped out keep us afloat, I'm sure that it's helping a lot of other people who are in the same predicament out this way," he said.

Canola crop estimates cut
The 2006 canola crop estimates have been reduced to 1.4 million tonnes - 50,000 tonnes down on last year.
The Australian Oilseeds Federation says late sowing in many areas, and cold, dry weather during June has led to the lower forecast.

Businessman fined $1.2m over abalone trade
A Queensland businessman has been fined a record $1.2 million for his role in an elaborate abalone trading ring.
David Wei Meng Lee was been found guilty in Hobart's Criminal Court of five counts of illegally possessing abalone.
Between August 2001 and March 2002 the 49-year-old received consignments of dried abalone from Tasmania at his Gold Coast seafood retail outlet.
Lee is one of 17 people who were charged as a result of a police surveillance program known as Operation Oakum.
The $1.2 million fine is the largest penalty imposed on any of them.
In handing down the fine, Justice Shan Tennant said she thought it unlikely Lee would be able to pay it all.

'Contractual requirements' delay wheat shipment
There have been more delays in shipping wheat to India, with grain from Western Australia under intense scrutiny to ensure it meets tough contractual requirements.
Quarantine concerns have held up two previous shipments to India this year.
The latest consignment is being loaded onto a ship at Esperance today, which has been waiting in the bay for more than two weeks.
AWB'S Western Australian manager, Paul Ryan, says a combination of factors caused the delay.
"There's a very strict and extensive pre-testing and testing program before the vessel is loaded that has to be adhered to under this Indian contract," he said.

Shipping delay to leave US retailers short of fruit
There is a looming shortage of Australian citrus in US supermarkets, after engine problems delayed the third shipment of this year's exports.
The ship was delayed in Port Adelaide by 12 days.
Steve Allen, from exporter Riversun, says it will be the first time market demand cannot be met.
"Unfortunately we will run out of fruit for probably a week or less, which means that some supermarkets may go to South Africa but look there is a shortage of fruit in the United States," he said.

Productivity review results disappointing: Truss
State and federal-owned corporations dealing with road, rail, ports and other export infrastructure are under-performing, according to a new analysis by the Productivity Commission.
Treasurer Peter Costello has seized on the report as another example of the need for the Federal Government to take control of important national assets, although the Opposition says the Government's track record is woeful.
Federal Transport Minister Warren Truss says the review results are disappointing.
He says the mindset within government-owned companies has to change.
"Obviously we expect maximum performance from our services and our utilities - that's essential to build a productive trading arrangement and to ensure that our country is able to pay its way," he said.
"It is disappointing that some companies do not perform well,.
"Of course the very act of corporatising a utility doesn't make it profitable.

Audit report urges illegal land clearing test cases
A new report by the New South Wales auditor-general shows 40 per cent of the 74,000 hectares cleared of vegetation last year was done illegally.
While satellite images are being used to provide accurate information for the first time, the report shows illegal clearing is not as widespread as conservationists have claimed.
Auditor-General Bob Sendt is warning farmers, particularly in western New South Wales, that with new laws, the State Government is in a position to clamp down on illegal clearing.
"The Government and the Department of Natural Resources needs to make it clear to those elements of the rural community that want to continue to clear land illegally that the new legislation does have bite," he said.

Victorian water traders set new record
There is more evidence of growing agricultural water sales in Victoria, with a record amount of permanent water traded in the state's north-west last financial year.
Almost 26,000 megalitres of additional water moved into the region, mainly from upstream along the Murray River.
Owen Russell from Lower Murray Water says most of the new water is being used by almond growers between Robinvale and Nyah.
"We've seen water come in effectively from out of the Goulburn Murray irrigation district region," he said.

Rain boosts young cattle prices
Recent rain across parts of the eastern seaboard has helped to drive up cattle prices.
The Eastern Young Cattle Indicator, a benchmark of young cattle prices across saleyards in eastern Australia, jumped eight cents to 371 cents dressweight last night.
AgConcepts Analyst Angus Brown says a tight supply of cattle and increased demand from producers has prompted the increase, which is likely to continue.
"Low supply always forces prices up as lot feeders looking for cattle and processors looking for cattle and restockers are looking for something to put on the grass they are going to have in about a month," he said.

Australian, NZ dairy farmers share research costs
They might be rivals in international trade but Australian and New Zealand dairy farmers are about to get a whole lot closer, with a new partnership to share research costs.
Following support from farmer organisations in both countries, Dairy Australia and New Zealand company Dairy Insight will focus on improving pre-farmgate research, including industry development, education and training.
The head of the Australian Dairy Industry Council, Allan Burgess, says it makes sense to reduce costs.
"We think there's very limited resources available for farmers and things we can do together are going to be more efficient," he said.

New Middle East lamb exports record set
Australia has recorded its highest ever monthly sales figures for lamb to the Middle East.
In June, sales hit 824 tonnes - 100 tonnes higher than the previous record.
Ian Ross, the Middle Eastern manager for Meat and Livestock Australia, says the quality of Australian lamb is recognised by supermarket and restaurant buyers.
"There's a great response now to the flavour of Australian lamb, and also there's a strong awareness of [it]," he said.
"We've been doing all we can now for some time to encourage the awareness of the safety systems and the traceability, the integrity of the Australian halal system because we are talking about a Muslim community.

Algae project wins renewable energy grant
A Queensland company trying to produce biodiesel from algae is among the recipients of $10.5 million in federal grants for renewable energy projects.
Energy Minister Ian Macfarlane says Brisbane company SQC is getting $220,000 for its work with algae.
"The algae produces an oil extract which can then be used for biodiesel," he said.
The company wants to commercialise a process which could be suitable for farm dams and irrigation lagoons.
The biggest grant recipient is CSR Sugar's centre at the University of Queensland, which has received $5 million for work to produce a new sugarcane with more fermentable sugar suitable to ethanol and biofuels.

Internet helps farmers recruit backpackers
Video conference technology is helping job agencies tap into the backpacker market in Australia's far north-west.
One company has set up remote facilities in Broome, Western Australia, interviewing travelling workers over the Internet and then employing them to work in the farm sector.
One of the regions looking for workers is the east Kimberley, which looks set to have a bumper mango harvest.
Grower Lachlan Dobson doubts local labour will meet demand.
"There's guesstimates going around at the moment that Kununurra mango production might be up around 400,000 trays," he said.

Project Gold to tell farm families' stories
A youth arts project has been launched in southern New South Wales to stimulate debate about water use and drought.
Under Project Gold more than 30 students will develop digital and media skills by working with the not-for-profit organisation BIG hART.
Spokesman Casey Ankers says their new skills will be used to tell the stories of farm families from southern Queensland to northern Victoria.
"What we're looking at doing is skilling up the young people to work with us, work with the BIG hART artists and go out to rural communities and gather narratives from rural families that have been affected by the drought," he said.

Countries aim to salvage trade deal
The world's most influential trade ministers are meeting in Geneva this weekend to try to resurrect global free trade talks.
Six nations, including Australia, will be attempting to salvage a deal.
Australia's push to reduce trade barriers is receiving support from local meat importers in Europe.
The Australian sheepmeat sector is pushing for an increase to the 19,000 tonne sheepmeat quota in the European Union.
One of the biggest importers of lamb and beef into France, Claude Thieblemont, says if import quotas were lifted, local consumption could double.
"France is very short of production, we supply 40 per cent of all needs and we import 60 per cent of our lamb from abroad," he said.
"We would expect to import more from Australia because we like the Australian product. French suppliers [are] buying five kilo per capita per year which is very low and we could multiply this by two or three, easily."
Professor Andrew Stoler from the Institute for International Trade says world leaders appear keen to agree to reforms after this week's G8 summit in St Petersburg.
He says that should help to break the deadlock.
"What is going to move the process forward is not the sort of political direction that came out of the recent G8 meetings," he said.
"You can't really get any higher level than that unless God comes down and tells them you have to get a deal.

Authority approves canola export licences
The Grains Licensing Authority (GLA) in Western Australia has approved three small export licences for 75,000 tonnes of canola aimed at higher priced markets in Europe and the Middle East.
GLA chairman Wayne Obst says higher tonnages were not approved because crop predictions are forecast to be dismal this year.
Two applications to send malting barley to China were knocked back because of the dry conditions in the west.
Mr Obst says the authority can easily prove the restriction on export licences will benefit growers.
"These canola licences have gone to a higher priced market, that's been caused by the request for canola into the biodiesel market," he said.

Much needed rain falls on very dry regions
There is some hope for Western Australia's grain growers today after rain fell overnight in some very dry regions.
While it is too late for farmers in the large grain growing districts in the northern-mid-west, moderate to good falls further south will boost thirsty crops.
Weather bureau forecaster Noel Puzey says the really good news is that a more wintry weather pattern is setting in.
"There have been some reasonable falls to help people along at the moment, falls range from about six millimetres at Dalwallinu in the Central Wheatbelt to 20 millimetres through some parts of the Great Southern and it is still moving through to the east so mainly southern districts can pick up a few showers around the place," he said.
A group of Victorian farmers are developing a national grading system for biodiesel to assure its quality.
With more and more farmers blending their own fuel, the Central Wimmera Community Enterprise group says the system will quash concerns that biodiesel could damage engines.
Chairman Peter Neiwand says once an Australian biodiesel standard is in place, the Federal Government will be lobbied to reinstate tax breaks.

US to scale back mad cow disease testing
United States Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns says his department will scale back its expanded testing for mad cow disease due to its extremely low rates.
Mr Johanns says years of expanded and normal testing shows the US is likely to have four to seven infected animals and reducing current testing almost ten-fold to 40,000 a year is still well above international guidelines.
Mr Johanns dismisses concerns the move will cause a new rift with Japan, whose food safety body wants continued high US testing.
"We have bent over backwards with the Japanese, we've even agreed with them to ship only beef from animals under 20-months and that's a very unique, very, very unusual agreement," he said.

Qld mining sector continues to boom
Queensland's mining boom continues to power ahead with the Queensland Government nominating a large parcel of land for future mineral exploration.
Labor Member for Mount Isa Tony McGrady says nearly 3,500 square kilometres will be offered under a tender system for prospective mining companies.
He says they will also get data showing deposits of copper, lead, zinc and silver.
"As a result of the work they now have information on mineral prospectivitiy in an area of land bigger than the ACT," he said.

SAFF seeks help to boost membership
South Australia's peak farming body wants farmers to help boost membership levels.
Only 65 farmers made the trip to a public workshop in Adelaide today to help redirect the South Australian Farmers Federation (SAFF) into the future.
SAFF is asking farmers across the state to come up with ideas to make the organisation more relevant particularly to younger farmers.
The organisation's membership is falling there are currently 4,000 members while there were 11,000 back in the 1980's.

Grower challenges importers to buy Aust coffee beans
An organic coffee producer from New South Wales is challenging Australia's three main coffee importers to buy locally grown beans.
Australians drink nearly 50,000 tonnes of coffee a year and almost all of it is imported.
Organic grower Cath Ford says the industry has to demonstrate the quality of local coffee to consumers and coffee suppliers.
"Quite frankly people will buy commodity fair trade coffee over Australian coffee if we can not get across that the quality and flavour is different," she said.
"We need to get on our bandwagon and show that what we have is a supreme product over other people's."

Scientists discover bug behind sheep mastitis
Scientists have discovered sheep mastitis is being caused by a different bug than first thought.
The inflammation of milk glands kills 5 per cent of ewes in Poll Dorset, Suffolk and Texel flocks each year.
Dr Stuart Barber from the University of Melbourne has found mannheimia is the most common bacteria causing the problem.
It was previously thought staphylococcus brought on the disease, as it does in cows.
Dr Barber says this new information is crucial.

Sprouts can curb cancer: DPI
New research has shown eating the sprouts that are often found in mixed salads can help curb cancer.
The Queensland Department of Primary Industries (DPI) has investigated 22 different brassicas, including broccoli and cauliflower.
It has found sprouts can contain up to 200 times more of a chemical which helps dissolve carcinogens, than mature vegetables do.
DPI physiologist Tim O'Hare says radish and broccoli sprouts rated the highest.

Program aims to get country kids talking about depression
A new program tackling depression in country schools is trying to encourage students and teachers to be more open about mental illness.
The beyondblue program comes as new research shows depression and suicide are the two biggest concerns for country kids.
And while students are most likely to turn to their families and friends for support, it is hoped they will also open up to their teachers.
Queensland school counsellor Gary Quinn says students at his school are becoming more willing to talk about depression.
"Most students, once they start doing something to say 'hey help me', they really do want some help," he said.

Fergies flock to flood festival
The heroic feats of the famous grey Ferguson tractor are being celebrated in the New South Wales town of Wentworth this weekend.
The Festival of the Flood will see 300 fergies of all shapes are sizes attending to commemorate massive floods in 1956.
The fergies will be the stars of the show because they were used to build levee banks to stop the rising floodwater and protect the town.
Fergie enthusiast John Reeves from Geelong will be there and can not wait to catch up with others who share his passion.

Website to track drought impact
The Federal Government has unveiled its plan to make it easier for farmers to apply for drought relief.
The national agricultural monitoring system is a website which will track how major agricultural regions are performing.
While state governments could take weeks or months to collate drought information under the old application process, John Sims from the Bureau of Rural Sciences says the new system will take minutes.
"There's information on rainfall, there's information on how that rainfall affects pasture and crop growth, and how that translates into impact on say farm financial performance over the last couple of years," he said.

Councils come to farmers' aid
With Western Australia in the grip of a dry year, local councils are looking for different ways to help farmers who are struggling to grow a crop this season.
The Shire of Mullewa and the Shire of Chapman Valley will offer road works and community project works to farmers, so they can generate an income.
Mullewa president Nino Messina says the council has received extra funding for road works and employing farmers makes sense.
"The harvesting will come and farmers won't be able to do anything because they'll have no crop to harvest," he said.
The Queensland Nationals are calling on the Federal Government for better measures to protect regional media diversity under its proposed changes to media ownership laws.
The Nationals want the Government to set a mandate for local radio content and legislation to prevent a single company from owning more than two out of three news services in regional centres, including television, radio and newspapers.
But lecturer in media policy and research at the University of Western Sydney Dr Tim Dwyer says the provisions in the Nationals' resolution fall well short of any sort of guarantee to provide a diverse range of local news.

PigPass to identify food safety risks
Pork producers have welcomed a new identification system to trace animals from pig pen to plate.
PigPass is a national vendor declaration form which must accompany pigs being processed for domestic and export markets.
It is being rolled out now and should be fully in place by January 2007.
David Miles from the Victorian Farmers Federation's pig group says any disease or food safety risks will be identified with the new pass.
"There's got to be traceback. If we haven't got traceability well we're not going to be able to export or do anything professionally and it will control the industry, as I understand, and the VFF pig group we're quite happy with this," he said.

Labor backs calls for quarantine system inquiry
The Federal Opposition has joined calls for an independent inquiry into Australia's quarantine system.
The call follows moves from the New South Wales Government and the New South Wales Farmers Association for a Senate inquiry.

Top End water region to be mapped
The last major unstudied water region of the Northern Territory's Top End is about to be mapped and modelled.
The Gulf region extends from Mataranka to the Gulf of Carpentaria and has a number of large, permanently running rivers.
Over the next three years the Territory Government will uncover not only how the aquifers and rivers interact, but also measure how much water the environment uses.
Project officer Ursula Zarr says they need to know how much water there is so they can protect everyone's interests.

Committee chairman rules out renewed push for Hydro privatisation
The chairman of an New South Wales Upper House Committee looking at the future of the Snowy Hydro scheme has rejected reports that it will renew a push for privatisation.
The State Government ruled out trying to sell off its share of the scheme earlier this year, when the Federal and Victorian Governments pulled out of the plan.

Banana industry looks at cyclone-proofing
The banana industry is looking at ways to become cyclone-proof to avoid a repeat of this year's shortage.
The Australian Banana Growers Council wants to strengthen smaller growing areas, such as Western Australia's Gascoyne to ensure customer demand can be met.
Cyclone Larry wiped out most of north Queensland's crop in March, driving up the price of available fruit.
Spokesman Tony Heidrich says markets and retailers need to allow smaller growing areas to keep a foothold in the market once Queensland fruit returns.
"You'll never completely cyclone proof the industry," he said.
"But what we're saying is we've obviously got a real problem this time around in having such a big cyclone knock out so much of our production.

No breakthrough in world farm trade talks
There is no sign yet of a breakthrough in last ditch world farm trade talks in Geneva.
The G6, including Australia, Japan, the US and the European Union is meeting in what is considered a final attempt to resolve five years of discussions about trade reform.

Dairy co-ops increase returns to farmers
New South Wales regional dairy cooperatives have bucked the trend of the major milk processors by increasing returns to farmers this season.
Norco and the Bega Cooperative on the north and south coasts have announced step-ups in their milk prices.
Janet Moxey from the New South Wales Farmers Association has welcomed the move and believes it could be due to a delay in passing on last year's high returns.
"I don't think New South Wales farmers have actually seen the flow-on of the good times in Victoria last year," Ms Moxey said.
"Farmers in New South Wales locked into contracts for a 12-month period and didn't see the step-up payments that were paid out in Victoria.

Egg farmer seeks tightening of free-range legislation
Consumers are being warned that eggs marked 'free-range' could actually come from caged birds.
Some producers claim that some farmers are falsely labelling their eggs and are urging consumers to look out for accreditation from an independent authority like the RSPCA.
Free range farmer Tom Fryar has told ABC TV's Landline program that there is no legal definition of the term free-range and legislation should be tightened.

Book to focus on mothers and daughters-in-law' relationship
The relationships between mothers and their daughters-in-law on family farms is set to go under the microscope in a new book by a South Australian author.
Abi Spehr, from Beachport in South Australia, says introducing a new person into an established family business can be traumatic regardless of whether the two women get along.
She says there has been little research done on what can be a difficult relationship and it is time there was.

Tas vodka wins international awards
A Tasmanian distillery which exports vodka to Russia has won two international awards at the Wine and Spirits Fair in London.
The Tamar Distillery, at Beauty Point in northern Tasmania, received bronze medals for its citrus-infused dry gin and Tasmanian pepperberry vodka.
Manager Phillip Ridyard says Tasmania's pristine water helped the company to crack into the tough Russian market.
"The primary reason is the water and the selection of the water because the crucial part of vodka is low calcium," Mr Ridyard said.
"And we produce three blends using three waters, one from the west coast, one from near Scottsdale and a sample from York Town.
"We then held a blind tasting with a group of expatriate Russians.

Wine glut blamed for price drop
Wine prices have hit an all-time low, with a major supermarket chains selling bottles of clean skin chardonnay and merlot for $2.00 a bottle.
The move has sent shockwaves through the battling industry, with the wines normally selling for $6.00.
The massive discounting is being blamed on the wine glut and follows a trend set in the US in 2003.
Chief executive of the Wine Makers Federation of Australia Stephen Strachan says it is a very worrying development.
"I don't think anyone in the industry would've expected that we get to that point," he said.
"What it does is it undermines the strength of existing brands and it means that the temptations for those brands to try and meet similar price points is there because they obviously want to be able to sell their wine.

Farmers warned to watch out for food mile phenomenon
Australian farmers have been warned to take note of a new consumer trend in the United Kingdom.
Companies who import Australian beef into Britain and the European Union are wary of the new phrase 'food miles' which could be used to limit imports into that country.
Food miles refers to the growing practice of importers and supermarket chains stacking their shelves with exotic items from around the world.
The criticism is they are chewing through too much aircraft and truck fuel in getting them there, thereby increasing carbon emissions.
Retail manager from Global, UK's biggest meat importer and also an importer of Australian beef, Bob Rose, says we need to keep an eye on the food mile phenomenon.
"In the UK at the moment, global warming is a very big issue," Mr Rose said.
"And one of the issues that has raised its head is bringing product from around the world, and the costs of the carbon emissions to the environment of bringing that product from around the world; would it not bet better sourcing locally-produced product?

Uranium conference to discuss Labor backflip
A bid by Labor leader Kim Beazley to dump his party's opposition to new uranium mines is expected to be a major talking point at the annual Australian Uranium Conference in Perth this week.
Three hundred uranium experts, including 30 delegates from China, are at the conference.
Uranium Information Centre chief executive and conference delegate Ian Hore-Lacey says a major change in political opinion could lead to Australia exporting more uranium.
With current exports going to Korea, Europe and Japan he says the next two big customers will be China and India.
"China is quadrupling its nuclear capacity by 2020 and it's going to need to import most of the uranium to fuel that," he said.
"India is another possible country but that's much further out.

Draft timber harvesting regulations anger landowners
Landowners in New South Wales are angry at the State Government's draft regulations for timber harvesting in privately-owned forests.
The result of years of debate, the code of practice aims to protect rare timber species, and wildlife and biodiversity, on farms.
But it does not include compensation for landowners.
Robert Dyason, a tree grower in the state's north, believes the draft code is a missed opportunity.
"We could have been presented with a complete package of code, education and compensation for reserved areas, it would have promoted adaptive management with provision for improvement in management as knowledge improved," Mr Dyason said.

Fire and factory closure leaves 100 jobless
Almost 100 jobs will be lost with the closure of a fibre board factory in Tasmania's north.
Carter Holt Harvey has announced it will shut down its Bell Bay plant, which produces the building product MDF.
Operations there were suspended a month ago after a multi-million dollar fire.
Andrew Eastick from Northern Tasmanian Development says it was a difficult decision.
"The plant has always been marginal and one of the difficulties for the plant is the market for MDF has moved on, it produces a material which is only able to be manufactured down to a certain thickness," Mr Eastick said.
"Is the plant able to be re-engineered so that it can produce an MDF material that can attract a premium?

Fungal disease could wipe out WA wheat crops
A disease that can completely wipe out wheat crops appeared for the first time this season in Western Australia.
The fungal disease stripe rust, which can reduce crop yields by up to 90 per cent, has been spotted in the state's south, near Esperance.
Agronomist Phil Smyth says farmers are growing wheat varieties with better resistance to the disease but this outbreak could be similar to the epidemic of two years ago.

Two confirmed cases of Q fever in NSW border city
Victoria's Department of Human Services has confirmed two cases of Q fever in the border city of Wodonga.
A third person is suspected of contracting the disease, which causes heavy flu-like symptoms.
People working with livestock are usually most at risk of the disease, although the two confirmed patients do not work with livestock.
Director of population health in Albury, Tony Kolbe, says it is unusual, but not impossible, for people who do not work with animals to become ill.

Average rainfall expected right across Australia
The Bureau of Meteorology says most of Australia looks set for average rainfall over the next three months, although the north-east could be drier.
The bureau says there is a 60 to 80 per cent chance of below average rain in the region from Daly Waters in the Northern Territory, south to the corner country and across to Rockhampton in Queensland.
Elsewhere there is a 50 per cent chance of at least average rainfall between August and October.

Producing, manufacturing costs higher than expected
The costs of manufacturing goods and growing produce have risen higher than expected, adding more weight to a forecast interest rate rise next week.
Theoretically the big price increases for producing bananas, grains, beef, sheep and dairy products should mean a pay rise for farmers.
But the ANZ bank's chief economist Saul Eslake says the jump in producer prices reflects a lack of supply due to weather conditions, higher fuel prices, and interest rates.
"Drought has constrained grain supplies, the long-term reduction in sheep numbers across Australia has been a factor in rising meat prices, rising beef prices are partly due to the very good prices that Australian producers have been getting overseas and sugar prices have roughly trebled," he said.

Black truffles yields 'fantastic'
The black truffle industry is enjoying its best ever season.
Low yields have plagued growers in recent years but Tim Terry from Tasmanian Truffle Enterprises says his harvest has tripled this season and it is a similar story around Australia.
"There are certainly some very good yields on the mainland and in Western Australia there have been some fantastic yields of much older plantations of course," Mr Terry said.

Suspension of trade talks costing farmers
The National Farmers Federation (NFF) says the overnight suspension of world trade talks has cost Australian farmers $1.5 billion in potential new markets.
The G6 group of nations including Australia, Japan, the US and European Union failed to resolve five years of discussions about agricultural trade reform.
Scott Mitchell from the NFF says the US failed to agree to further subsidy cuts, while Europe would not drop its import barriers.
"All Australian agricultural industries are extremely disappointed at the suspension of the WTO [World Trade Organisation] negotiations overnight," Mr Mitchell said.
"This is a huge lost opportunity for Australian farmers to lock in the elimination of export subsidies, to lock in significant cuts in agricultural subsidies being spent around the world and to lock in actual improvements in market access."
Meanwhile Nationals leader Mark Vaile has played down speculation that he will now hand the trade portfolio over to Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran.
"I think that there's still a lot more that can be done, as we've got quite a busy agenda on the bi-lateral front with negotiations well under way with China and Malaysia and the ASEAN [South East Asian Nations] countries and I'm certainly keen to pursue those," Mr Vaile said.
US farmers say they will fight to retain their current level of subsidies, now that the trade talks have stalled.
Lobby group, the US Farm Bureau, says farmers are not prepared to give ground until Europe offers more concessions.
The group's spokesman, Chris Garza, says internal debate will now begin on the next US farm bill due next year, and farmers will attempt to lock in subsidies.
"What we've seen is, as these negotiations have gone on countries like the European Union has requested more and more from the United States to give up," Mr Garza said.
"We feel as an organisation that there's no reason to give up anything at this point. which means we should not make any changes to our farm bill so that when these negotiations do begin again, we're still where we were before, and we still have something to give up if we have to give something up."
America's top trade official says the collapse of global trade talks means the US presidential trade deal authority will now likely expire, before any WTO deal can be saved and sent to the US Congress.
There has been a US push to complete a new world trade deal this year leaving enough time for the US Congress to ratify it before the presidential trade deal authority expires next July, when the body could again amend any deal possibly killing it.
US trade ambassador Susan Schwab says the worst will now likely happen.
"We do not expect to be able to use the current TPA [US Trade Promotion Authority] to enact a Doha Round agreement, if and when one comes together," Ms Schwab said.

Rare butterfly found in Arnhem Land
A rare and endangered butterfly in north-east Arnhem Land is now a bit safer.
The gove crow butterfly was previously thought to live in only four small patches of rainforest, but now a fifth location has been confirmed.
Naturalist Ian Morris says he first saw the butterfly 30 years ago, but was only recently able to confirm it was the gove crow.
"It certainly extends its range by a few hundred kilometres, but probably doesn't stop them being an endangered or threatened species simply because the habitat they live in is so restricted and unique that any disturbance to that could soon cause a crash in their population," he said.

Church offers support to stricken farmers
Farmers in the driest parts of Western Australia are hoping for some divine intervention this week.
Anglican Archbishop of Perth Roger Herft and regional Bishop Tom Wilmot are touring the mid-west and wheat belt, to meet with farmers and offer support.
Bishop Wilmot says the turnout has been huge so far.
"One farmer said that it's a bit like grief or having a death in the family, but there's no burial, because every day you stand on the porch and you look out at the body, as it were," he said.
"I can sympathise with that because these people identify very closely with the land. There is a level of grief there, but as with all grief, it draws families together.

Drought officers angry over job loss
Community drought officers in Victoria's Wimmera region are at a loss to explain why their jobs have been cut.
Three of the four positions are no longer being funded by the Victorian Government, even though the drought is lingering across the region.
Former community drought officer in Yarriambiac Shire, Faye Smith says they met with the Department of Human Services and the State Drought Committee in Horsham yesterday but still do not know if they have a job.
"I was totally amazed," she said.
"To me it just seemed the strangest decision and now more than ever the community strengthening is needed.
"I cannot understand why the State Government would make the decision to wipe out the position when, as most people will tell you, that the situation now is probably as dire as it's ever been."

SA loses rural counsellors
The number of rural financial counsellors in South Australia will be scaled back, following changes to the way the service is provided.
The Federal Government spent two years reviewing the program and opened up tenders for a single, state-based provider in April.
The service will now be run by the newly formed Rural Financial Counselling South Australia.
Spokesman John Voumard says it will allow counsellors to be allocated to areas of need.
"There are periods of demand and they occur at different times in different areas," he said.

Uranium shortage forces commodity price up
As Australia debates the merits of opening up new uranium mines, analysts say a global shortage of the commodity is pushing up prices.
The spot price for uranium has jumped $US2 in the past week to $US47.25 per pound.
ANZ Bank commodity analyst Andrew Harrington says half of the world's nuclear power is currently sourced from recycled nuclear weapons left over from the Cold War.
He says Australia's massive reserves of uranium are in high demand for nuclear powered plants, because recycled uranium is running out.
"Mostly it was to do with the renewed interest in uranium as a commodity, because the recycled uranium from nuclear weapons is starting to decline, so the primary source of uranium coming from mines needs to make up for that shortfall," he said.

Quarantine boost following marine pest find
The increased threat of an exotic marine pest has prompted Northern Territory authorities to strengthen offshore quarantine measures.
The black-striped mussel has been found twice in the past week on seized illegal fishing vessels inside Darwin Harbour.
The pest was found after the boats were moored.
Territory Fisheries spokesman Peter Zeroni says quarantine checks will now be done five nautical miles offshore.
"As a result of events that occurred last week, we have made a decision as an interim measure to now inspect all vessels out at the five nautical mile buoy in open water, where the risk is less," he said.
"The risk at 1.5 is low due to it being an open-water environment ... however, as a precautionary measure we have moved the boats now further out.
"From an NT Fisheries perspective, the risk is manageable where they are. We are concerned about the NT's internal waters, waters within three nautical miles and probably out to 10.
"We have a strong interest in ensuring those waters are free of aquatic pests."

Grain prices rise as US turns to ethanol
The rising cost of fuel in America is having a positive impact on Australian wheat prices, according to an agriculture publication.
More consumers in the US are turning to corn-based ethanol, increasing corn consumption by 15 per cent to 60 million tonnes and boosting prices by up to 20 per cent.
Richard Koch from Profarmer says the US corn price sets the basis for the global feed grain market, which will have spin offs for Australian wheat and canola growers.
"I've seen some analysis that indicates the value of soft commodities in the medium-term could increase six-fold," he said.

AWB legal battle back before court
The legal battle over the future of the oil-for-food inquiry is back in the Federal Court today.
This time a challenge has been initiated by Commissioner Terence Cole, who does not want to participate in the case about AWB's claim to withhold documents from his inquiry.
The Commissioner's lawyers are asking the court to determine the legitimacy of AWB's claim of legal professional privilege over 1,300 documents.

Farmers seek better food label laws for online shopping
Farmers say an oversight by Australia's peak food regulator is allowing fruit and vegetables to be sold on the Internet without new country-of-origin labelling.
Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) introduced the tougher labelling laws last month after farmers fought for imported food to be clearly identified.
However, with major supermarkets now offering online grocery sales, the rules do not apply.
Brian Bond from the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association says FSANZ should have identified the issue.
"It's obviously been an oversight by Food Standards Australia and New Zealand and it's something that certainly needs to be looked at and if we can plug the gap we should," he said.
"We need sales and I guess this area of sales is going to increase rather than decrease so it's certainly something that needs addressing."
Lydia Buchtmunn from FSANZ says the issue has not been overlooked.
"Actually we've been addressing that for quite a long time we've been looking at the whole labelling standard to look at things perhaps that are home delivered," she said.

US producers weary of resumption in Japan trading
Cattle producers in the United States are not hopeful of a quick resumption of their beef trade to Japan, despite a successful tour of US meat plants by Japanese inspectors.
The beef trade is awaiting confirmation that US beef will again be allowed into Japan after a two-year bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)-related ban.
The ban was lifted late last year but reimposed after early shipments were found to contain traces of spinal cord.
Jay Truitt, from the National Cattlemens Beef Association, thinks many producers and processors might not want to supply Japan again.
"I think there's some excitement, obviously, it's tempered, because history has been a good teacher for us, that we shouldn't get too excited," he said.
"More importantly though, from our perspective, is that we really look at our industry and we begin to now look sincerely at what are the opportunities for us in Japan and they're still quite limited and we're not going to over prepare for it, it's an expensive market for us to function.

No growth predicted for south-west WA pastures
The CSIRO says pasture growth rates in Western Australia's south-west are shaping up to be the worst in nearly 100 years.
New satellite data shows growth rates are expected to be down 60 per cent on last year, due to abnormal weather patterns.
The CSIRO's Dr Steve Gherhardi says, as a result, many farmers have reduced stock numbers to give paddocks a spell.
"Even now, if farmers have had a break, they'd need to make decisions on how long they would want to defer that pasture to ensure that they'll get some growth occurring," he said.

Drought, costs force farmers to cut water usage
The number of irrigated Australian farms has dropped a further 13 per cent, according to a new report by the bureau of statistics.
In the year 2004-05, just over 35,000 Australian farms used irrigation, down 5,000 on the year before.
The report shows less water is being used to grow pasture and rice, although more is going into growing cotton.
Doug Miell from the New South Wales Irrigators Council says the fall is partly due to drought, but also because of high water prices.
He says many irrigators are focusing on crops, which give them a higher return, or selling their water.
"There's obviously a consolidation happening right across agriculture in the irrigation sector, there's no difference in that regard," he said.

Wool companies look at partial integration
The boards of Australia's two peak wool companies are still talking up the industry's future despite now having to look at ways of joining forces without a full merger.
Plans to unit Australian Wool Services (AWS) with Australian Wool Innovation are on hold while the Federal Government decides whether to help AWS pay off a $27 million overseas debt.
Chairman Barry Walker is hopeful the Government will come to the rescue, but says the two companies are looking at how to integrate parts of their organisations anyway.
"There are certainly major savings in running a single company," he said.

Public interest tests urged before hospital closures
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) wants all state governments to introduce public interest tests before downgrading or closing any more public hospitals in rural areas.
The doctors' lobby group says after years of neglect, governments should do whatever it takes to keep country public hospitals open and properly staffed.
AMA rural reference group chairman Dr David Rivett says the test should examine how closures affect the health needs of residents, local employment and the availability of other health services.
"We want to see the impact on the maintenance of skills of the medical workforce factored in, the impact on the health needs of the local communities and that includes the social dislocation they have when they have to travel many miles to seek treatment," he said.
"We want to see the impact of employment on the community when people have to travel with sick children to the cities and give up their jobs for days or weeks, and we want to see the availability of alternative resources all factored into the equation."

US lamb market set to slow down
There is a warning for lamb producers today that growth in the US market is set to slow down over the next year.
Sales of our lamb to the US grew by 28 per cent between 2004 and 2005 to become Australia's highest value market worth $327 million.
But Shane O'Hara from the Australian Lamb Company says exports are under pressure from similar factors to here, like competition from cheaper meats like chicken.
"We've seen some higher fuel costs, that's having a big pinch on disposable income," he said.

US blames Europe for collapse of trade talks
The blame game has started following the collapse of the Doha world trade talks.
Key nations have failed to agree on how to cut farm and industrial tariffs, and US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns is blaming Europe's refusal to let more beef in.
But Andrew McCallum from Meat and Livestock Australia says the trade talks did not detail individual agricultural products.
"I think what Johanns has done has just highlighted the beef issue as an example," he said.

Fruit wholesaler says banana returns increasing
A leading Queensland fruit wholesaler says he is surprised that bananas are being blamed for a higher than expected rise in inflation.
Economists blame skyrocketing banana prices, as well as fuel costs, for the 1.6 per cent jump in the June quarter Consumer Price Index.
More than 90 per cent of the Australian banana crop was wiped out earlier this year when cyclone Larry hit far north Queensland.
Peter Kedwell from the Brisbane Markets says while volume is down, returns are actually up.
"Bananas [on] average used to be around $15 to $20 a box, now it's $150 a box," he said.

Livestock transporter wants more rationalisation
There are calls today for more rationalisation and enforcement of legislation in the livestock transport sector.
Jim Cooper is the departing owner of the nation's largest livestock trucking fleet, Road Trains of Australia.
He has just sold his livestock fleet to another operator and believes it was a necessary step.
Mr Cooper will keep his other transport business and concentrate on the growing resources sector.
"The way the mining sector's regulated ... yes we can work within the legislation and compliance within the mining industry," he said.
"I certainly see some of the services for the remote area cattle haulage pulling back. I think a lot of the road trains, whether they are RTA or Hampton's, operate very much like a taxi rank.

Trip may have cleared up river diversion concerns
Local Aboriginal people may now be more open to the idea of expanding a Northern Territory lead and zinc mine.
Xstrata is currently seeking environmental approvals to move the McArthur River five and a half kilometres, so its mine can become an open-cut operation.
The company recently took a group of traditional owners to a coal mine in Victoria to see first hand what river diversion involves.
John Moriarty, the chairman of the Borroloola Community Reference Group, thinks the trip might have cleared up some concerns.

Farmer hopes assistance package will keep town afloat
The Western Australian Government has announced an assistance package for farmers in some of the State's most severely drought-affected regions.
Farmer Glenn Thomas was one of 150 locals at a dry season crisis meeting in the wheatbelt town of Mullewa yesterday.
Although details of the package are not yet known, Mr Thomas hopes it will help to keep his community afloat through the worst farming year he has ever known.
"There's different situations throughout the shires. There's many in the outlying areas that have really only had one good season in the last five or six and, really, that's just not enough to get back on your feet," he said.

Mental health concerns switch to young people in rural areas
The National Mental Health Initiative has raised concerns about the lack of information available about how the drought has affected young people in rural Australia.
Craig Hodges from beyondblue says the last survey was carried out in the late 1990s and data is up to 10-years-old.
He says the spin-offs from the drought are significant, with about a quarter of young people affected by depression, anxiety and other mental health issues.
"We only get this data every five to 10 years and the last one that was taken was in the late 90s which showed there was roughly one in four young women experiencing depression and one in six young men experienced depression," he said.
"They see what is happening with their parents, how parents respond to tough times on the farm and that also may mean there's less disposable income so that might mean they can't do the things they once did, so the spin-offs are quite significant."
The drought is also affecting young peoples choices at school.
At Redbank Catholic College in the west of central New South Wales, 68 students from across the state are studying agriculture in their final years.
Just a few say they will go onto work in the sector.

AWB announces restructure
Wheat exporter AWB has announced a further restructure to improve transparency but says it is not a result of the oil-for-food scandal.
Under the plan AWB International, which holds the licence for the single desk for exports, will be further separated from the company's corporate division.
It will have an independent board and management team, and its own governance and committee structure.
AWB chairman Brendan Stewart says the change is a result of feedback from grower groups and growers and is not a knee-jerk reaction to the Cole inquiry.
"These changes that we are making have absolutely nothing to do with the Cole inquiry, these are changes that we have initiated 18 months ago," he said.
"They have been a long time coming, they have been a process of detailed analysis and impact so that we delivered on the key promise that we gave to growers."
Mr Stewart rejects any suggestions from grower groups that it is too little too late.
"I don' think that's the case at all," he said.
Grains analyst Malcolm Bartholomaeus says there are major flaws in the restructure because the wheat sales division will not be part of AWB International and still will not be accountable enough.
"One of the implications is that the situation we've seen with the Iraq inquiry and the scandal there, and potentially the allegations of other payments being made in other market places, basically that could still happen again and put the single desk at risk with no control over the situation by AWB," he said.
AWB has rejected the suggestions.
Meanwhile AWB has cut its estimated before-tax profit by between 20 to 25 per cent.
The company says the drought has led to lower merchandise and fertiliser sales, and results have also been affected by difficult ongoing trading conditions and volatile world markets.
Profits for the year ending September 30 are expected to drop from a forecast $184.5 million to around $140 million.

Wool companies sign merger MOU
Australia's two peak wool companies will press on with a merger, despite an outstanding $27 million debt.
Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) and Australian Wool Services (AWS) have been in long-running talks about a merger, but the stumbling block has been AWS's outstanding debt to a UK-based superannuation fund.
The two companies have now signed a memorandum of understanding to look at the legal and financial implications of integration with work to start immediately.
The Federal Government had been approached to help pay off the debt, but the companies now say they will work together to solve the issue.

Producers told not to panic over Japanese beef decision
Japan has lifted its ban on US beef but the experts say Australian producers do not need to panic just yet.
Japan will only accept US beef under 20 months of age and from a limited number of accredited meat plants.
Meat and Livestock Australia says Australian exports to Japan should remain steady at around 390,000 tonnes a year.
Malcolm Foster from the Australian Lotfeeders Association does not think the US will pose any short-term threat and says other markets are available anyway.
"The alternate markets to Japan are obviously other Asian markets, in particular Korea, Taiwan and those markets, although markets in the Middle East and even markets in Russia are starting to open up now for Australian exporters," he said.
"So there are other markets but Japan will always be a very important one for us."
US cattlemen are upset over the tough restrictions imposed by Tokyo.
The National Cattlemen's Beef Association argues Japan's partial reopening is just a first step toward full resumption of trade worth $US1.4 billion, before America lost the market to Australia following a 2003 mad cow case.
The association's Jay Truitt says Tokyo's limits on US cattle age and number of plants that can ship is far too restrictive.
"Everyone of these restrictions adds cost to the system - that's not what we want," he said.

Food prices hit 15-year high
Australia has posted its biggest increase in food prices in 15 years.
Rabobank says the figures, which are being blamed for a big jump in inflation, show an 8.3 per cent rise in food costs.
But head of food and agribusiness research Bill Cordingley says the rise was mainly driven by soaring banana prices, with fruit prices up a stunning 52 per cent for the June quarter.
Prices rose for citrus fruit, apples, melons and strawberries, due to consumer demand for an alternative to bananas.

AWB restructure not enough, says US lobby group
America's peak grains lobby group claims a major restructure announced by wheat exporter AWB is just for show.
AWB has announced a multi-million dollar plan to separate its export arm AWB International from its corporate division.
As part of a push for better corporate governance, AWB International will continue to manage the single desk for wheat exports, but have its own management team and board.
Rebecca Coleman from US Wheat Associates says it still wants the AWB's monopoly on exports removed.
"US wheat does not think that it is going to make a difference, we think that it's just another show game and a shifting of boxes," she said.
"US Wheat's concerns has always been the power of the monopoly board, the way that they function in distorting trade and so a shifting of boxes around doesn't change the monopoly structure."
Australia's peak body, the Grains Council, will not comment on AWB's restructure plan.
In the wake of yesterday's announcement, AWB shares fell by 33 cents but recovered to finish at $3.85, just five cents below the opening price.
There has been little movement on the company's share price today, and Austock Agribusiness analyst Paul Jensz says the market has reacted positively.
"With this restructuring I think investors probably look at it as a first small step of a long road of recovery," he said.
"Investors broadly are saying that this level around $3.50-$3.90 is the bottom of AWB at this point." 

Crop forecasts
Winter crop forecasts in the eastern states have had a remarkable turnaround due to recent widespread rain.
Grain handler, Graincorp, says early prospects for this season were dismal, but after late breaks in June and July, it is expecting receivals of around 9 million tonnes.
Managing director Tom Keene says that is on par with the past two seasons.
"Victoria around 3 million tonnes and around 5 million tonnes in New South Wales, Queensland we would expect to get around 1 million tonnes," he said.

Biofuels Institute to be based in SA
Alternative feedstocks to supply the growing alternative fuels industry will be the focus of a new federally-funded Australian Biofuels Institute.

Ad campaign to highlight abuse of migrant visa program
The union movement has launched a campaign to highlight misuse of the skilled migrant visa program.
Under the 457 program, employers like abattoirs can import skilled workers when they can not be found locally.
Unions have now launched a $300,000 ad campaign highlighting abuses of the scheme and Graeme Bird from the Meat Industry Employees Union says they want action.

Govt urged to stop river environmental flows
Water shortages in western Victoria are now so severe that farmers are asking the State Government to halt environmental flows into rivers.
With reservoirs only 7 per cent full, farmers are facing the prospect of no available water to fill house dams and paying to cart the water they need for livestock and crop spraying.
President of the Victorian Farmers Federation Simon Ramsay says if there is not enough rain in August, water for rivers should be re-allocated to farms and homes.
"The 2,859 megalitres that sits under the bulk entitlement for environmental flows would be better used and have a greater impact to provide water for stock and domestic use, if needed, rather than the sort of nil effect it will have flushing down the Wimmera River," he said.
Meanwhile Australia needs five years of average rainfall to rebuild water levels in irrigation storages.
That is the view of Professor Wayne Meyer, chief scientist at the Co-operative Research Centre for Irrigation Futures.
Irrigators have not had full water allocations since 2001 and Professor Meyer says ongoing low rainfall has reduced the amount of water available by a third.
"If you look at the storage situation it will take several years of even average rainfall to get our storages back up to those, for example, that we had at the end of the 90s, early part of 2000," he said.

McGauran joins push to lift ban on GM crops
There is growing pressure on the states to lift their bans on commercial trials of genetically modified (GM) crops.
State governments have powers over land which they have used to impose the bans.
Now federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has joined farm groups in calling for the moratoria to be lifted, saying there are environmental and economic benefits from the technology.
"I believe the states' opposition to genetically modified crops is purely philosophical or ideological, it makes no economic or environmental sense," he said.
"Farmers should make the decision for themselves based on their reading of the marketplace.

New patrol boat to join illegal fishing fight
A new Navy patrol boat designed to monitor Australia's northern waters for illegal fishing will be commissioned at Port Pirie in South Australia tomorrow.
The Armidale class ship, to be called HMAS Pirie, is the latest in a new fleet of ships dedicated to border security operations.
Lieutenant Commander Kimbal Dunsmore, commanding officer of the new vessel, says the Navy is now much better equipped to intercept and board illegal fishing boats.
"These ships have cutting edge technology. They are a very, very complex machine that offer better endurance, better habitability, longer time on task and a better capability," he said.

Abattoir fish project likely to expand
The first attempt at growing fish in waste water from abattoirs has been successfully carried out in South Australia.
The lamb exporter, Tatiara Meat Company, uses about 1 million litres of water a day in its operations.
Most of it is recycled, but waste water held in storage ponds is now being used to grow goldfish, barramundi and carp, purifying the water so it can be used to grow fodder for livestock.
Environmental officer Fil Farina says the project is likely to expand.

Qld police investigate crop sabotage
North Queensland police are investigating the sabotage of crops in the horticulture district of Bowen.
Crops have been deliberately poisoned on four farms, causing a million dollars' damage to paddocks of watermelons, beans, tomatoes and capsicums.
Bowen company Queensland Seedlings lost thousands of plants in a similar attack in 2002, and no one has ever been charged.
Spokesman Andrew Paterson supplies seedlings to some of the affected farmers and says the damage has created a lot of fear and uncertainty.
"Basically someone out there, or persons, or person, I don't know, is holding us all to ransom," he said.

PM visits cyclone Larry affected communities
Prime Minister John Howard is in north Queensland today to meet victims of cyclone Larry, visiting communities between Innisfail and Tully.
Banana growers who had their crops wiped out will ask the PM to extend labour support schemes.

US drought hits sheep flock
The drought in the United States has not just hit the grain crop.
The latest US Department of Agriculture figures have shown the nation's sheep flock has fallen by 30,000 to 7.7 million head, denting hopes that numbers were rebuilding.
Meat and Livestock Australia says that is likely to increase US reliance on imports from countries like Australia for a number of years.

Qld shearer wins Diamond Shears comp
A shearer from southern inland Queensland has won the the Diamond Shears competition, run for the first time in five years at Longreach over the weekend.
Once regarded as the most prestigious shearing event in the southern hemisphere, organisers have battled insurance problems but managed to attract shearers from three states and New Zealand for this year's event.
Winner Laurie Bateman says he hopes it will help entice more young people into the wool industry.
"I think if we can keep these sport shearing competitions going, we may be able to entice a few more rural people out of the towns to come into our industry," he said.
"I can see it being the best show in Australia down the track. Anybody can shear a sheep or come into a shearing shed, wool handle, press, class, if you are fit and keen enough to get out there and earn a bit of money."

Meat industry agreement to tackle skilled visa abuse
The Australian Meat Industry Council is trying to stamp out abuse of the program to import skilled migrants to fill labour shortages.
Unions claim some employers are breaching the rules by underpaying workers, using skilled workers to perform unskilled jobs and not providing proper training.
The Immigration Department has frozen visa applications until the concerns are addressed.
Chief executive Kevin Cottrell says a labour agreement is being negotiated to ensure all sectors stay within the law.

Grains Council awaits AWB restructure details
Four days after news of a major restructure at wheat exporter AWB, the nation's peak grains body says it still needs more detail before it can comment.
AWB has announced the separation of its export and corporate arms, to improve transparency.
The Grains Council says it will continue to support the current system, and will not endorse any restructure proposals until the "oil for food" inquiry is over.
Chairman Murray Jones has rejected suggestions the council is responding too slowly.
"All AWB has given us is the press release and so we really haven't got any further detail," he said.
"They've spoken themselves about giving further detail over the period of time.

Qld unveils $1bn Toowoomba-Gladstone rail link
The Queensland Government has committed a billion dollars to complete a railway link between Toowoomba and the expanding central port of Gladstone.
Premier Peter Beattie says the 200 kilometres of rail will solve a "missing link" in the state's rail system.
It will mainly be used to transport billions of tonnes of coal from the Stuart Basin to port, but Everald Compton from the Australian Inland Expressway Project says grain growers will also benefit.
"Twenty million tonnes of coal a year will go out on the line but in addition it will mean that all the grain crops, the cotton and beef and all types of products can also use the port of Gladstone, which they are unable to do now," he said.

Wool growers seek speedy industry body merger
A rebel group of wool growers says a proposed merger between the industry's two peak bodies must be completed before producers are asked to vote to increase levies later this year.
Late last week, Australian Wool Innovation and Australian Wool Services signed a deal to look at the legal and financial implications of integration.
Martin Oppenheimer from the Australian Wool Growers Association has welcomed the move, and says it needs to happen quickly.
"The issue that we have now, moving forward, we've got Woolpoll 2006 coming up this December that will decide how much wool tax that wool growers will be spending for the next three years," he said.
"We need to know what the strategic plan is of the new merged entity.
"We can't be voting on a level of wool tax for the next three years if we don't know what the company will look like or what its goals will be."
In New South Wales, growers from the Goulburn-Yass branch of the Superfine Wool Growers Association voted unanimously to support the agreement at a meeting on Friday night.
Chairman John Ive says the merger talks have been dragging on for too long.
"With this sort of stand-off position between the two bodies, it wasn't giving good vibes to wool growers," he said.

Irrigators push for bore water sales to Toowoomba
Irrigators on Queensland's Darling Downs say they will push ahead with a plan to sell water to the Toowoomba City Council, after residents overwhelmingly voted against using recycled water.
At a referendum on Saturday, 62 per cent of Toowoomba residents said they were not prepared to use treated waste water to alleviate shortages.
John McVeigh, from lobby group NuWater, says irrigators can sell 5,000 megalitres of bore water to the city each year.
"Irrigators in our part of the world have put on the table a concept of urban rural water trade, now that's a concept that is getting support from CSIRO and is certainly something that has been practised in Israel and California," he said.

Shellfish disease spreads off Vic coast
Abalone divers and fisheries officers have been unable to stop the spread of a herpes-like disease, which is killing shellfish off the coast of south-west Victoria.
A 10 kilometre no diving and fishing zone was implemented off Port Fairy last month, but ganglioneuritis is now killing abalone a kilometre outside the boundary.
Mark Gervis, from South Ocean Mariculture, says as well as affecting wild stocks, the disease has hit on-shore abalone fish farms hard.

Online grain exchange nears launch
A consortium of agriculture and finance industry experts says it is almost ready to launch an Internet trading system for grain, oil seeds and legumes.
Wheat is the only commodity to be restricted to trade only in Australia.
Con Galtos from the Australian Grain Exchange is in negotiations with the major grain handling companies to talk up the benefits.
He says the system will give growers access to every price being offered in the international market place.
"The growers will know that the prices that they are offered for their grain are the prices that are offered for everybody else's grain, in other words it creates a level playing field," he said.

Wheat belt communities tackle achohol-related deaths
Communities in WA's wheat belt are trying to halt the growing number of alcohol-related deaths in the region.
The Wheatbelt Public Health Unit will work with the police to make drinking venues safer by training bar staff to stop serving customers when they have had enough.
Spokeswoman Julia Dick says most people would be shocked at just how many people are killed by alcohol each year.
"Probably about 15 deaths a year in the wheat belt are attributable to alcohol. There's about a further 2000 people hospitalised each year because of excessive alcohol use," she said.
"It comes at a financial cost of about $5.5 million, which is an enormous amount of money.

Tax review hits agribusiness shares
Nervous investors have wiped up to 25 per cent off the value of a number of companies involved in agribusiness managed investment schemes.
Companies including Great Southern, Timbercorp and Wilmott Forests have been hit in recent weeks.
Investment analyst Steve Johnson says some of the uncertainty is being caused by a federal review of the tax incentives offered for the schemes, which include timber, grapes, almonds and olives.
"Most other businesses certainly aren't as volatile as this, it would be a 25 per cent fall, I would say, in the last 3 weeks," he said.

US blamed for trade talks impasse
US President George W Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair say they will make a final effort to save stalled global trade talks after a weekend meeting at the White House.
The Doha talks are at standstill after major trading powers failed to reach agreement on reforms to international farm trade.
The European Commission's Ambassador to Australia, Bruno Julian, says Europe had offered to cut tariffs on imports from 80 per cent to 50 per cent, and blames the US for the impasse.
He says it is up to the US to cut its $26 billion in domestic subsidies to farmers.

Money needs to be spent on ports upgrade, inquiry chief says
The head of a federal inquiry into port, rail and road infrastructure says most of the nation's significant ports need upgrades worth around $80 million each.
Nationals Member for Hinkler in Queensland Paul Neville says money will need to be spent to protect Australian exports of minerals, grain, timber and mineral sands.
He says transport networks in general are having trouble keeping up with the needs of the export sector.
"We have found that at nearly every port there is a need for some sort of improvement to the connectivity between the main road and rail freight truck routes and the ports themselves," he said.
"Now it varies from port to port and at one it might be a new rail connection, in another one it might be a ring road around the port and another the widening of the channels into the ports.
"We feel they could probably do it a bit better."

PM's news an 'enormous relief' in rural Aust
There has been a largely warm response to Prime Minister John Howard's decision to stay on and fight the next federal election.
Mr Howard announced yesterday that he would not be handing over the top job to Treasurer Peter Costello.
Mark Patterson, from Currie Communications, expects country Australia to be happy with the move, which should increase the chances of another Coalition victory.

Benetton wool deal collapses
A major deal to double Australian wool sales to Italian fashion giant Benetton has collapsed.
The $1.6 million deal to step up sales to 4 million kilograms a year was only announced two weeks ago and would have made Benetton one of Australia's biggest wool retailers.
Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) will not go into detail, but says since the announcement issues have come up which can not be resolved by either company.
Chief executive Len Stephens is urging others not to use the collapse as an excuse to destabilise the wool industry.

Herbicide used to poison crops, police say
Police in north Queensland have confirmed that the common herbicide glyphosate was used to poison up to 40 hectares of fruit and vegetable crops near Bowen.
A special Queensland Government task force has been set up in the region, to find out how the poison, which is commonly known as Roundup, got into the system in the first place.
One million dollars damage has been caused to the crops and police now suspect a water source associated with crop spraying was contaminated.
Detective Inspector Warren Webber says the contamination is being treated as an act of sabotage.
"We obviously have look specifically in relation to which farms etc were being sprayed and that sort of thing," he said.

1080 poison not under threat in animal welfare strategy
Humane control methods will have to be used in the battle against pest animals, under the new Australian animal welfare strategy.
The strategy, to be finalised by the end of the year, will emphasise the need for ongoing training and accreditation in pest control, whether it be for wild dogs or cane toads.
But Tony English from the Wild Animal Working Group says the widely used toxin 1080 is not under threat at this stage.
"Not in the short term - 1080 at the moment is still too valuable a toxin for us for use in say wild dogs and foxes, that there's no suggestion at all that we would be looking to phase out 1080," he said.
"We can start to look for new toxins and that's happening but there is some research being done to incorporate analgesic drugs, pain killing drugs with the 1080 to make it perhaps more humane than it currently is.

Goats theft to hurt students
The head of an agricultural college in western Queensland says the theft of up to 300 boer goats will have a major impact on breeding and teaching programs.
Ten pure bred bucks, 90 does and up to 200 kids valued at $13,000 were stolen from the property, Manningham, near Longreach.
Peter Scott from the Australian Agricultural College Corporation says the theft will hurt students.
"Thirteen thousand dollars is a significant commercial loss for us because all our pastoral operations must support themselves, but you know 90 does out of our breeding herd that's a significant loss," he said.
"We're probably trying to develop a really good commercial meat goat flock so that we've got a good model for teaching and demonstration purposes."

New food labelling laws cover Internet shopping: FSANZ
Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) says Internet grocery sales are covered by new country of origin labelling laws.
Horticulturists had raised concerns that the labelling laws introduced in June had failed to include the rapidly growing online market.
At the time, the nation's food regulator said it would call for industry input to fix the problem.

Debris causing problems for scallop fishers
Scallop fishers have hit a snag while harvesting reopened scallop beds off the east coast of Tasmania.
Debris from a failed fishing venture in the 1980s is causing problems for operators, with dredges becoming tangled in abandoned nets and lines.
It has been 20 years since the scallop beds near Triabunna have been open for fishing and John Hammond from the Scallop Association of Tasmania says it is a mess.
"The rubbish that's coming up is quite extraordinary really," he said.
"Plastics and monofilament shark nets and that type of thing that was stuffed inside these plastic bags to catch the spat at the bottom's sort of eaten out of the bag, the actual bag that the plastics were stuffed into.

Elders Rural Bank profit up 10pc
Elders Rural Bank has announced a $30.7 million profit for the past financial year, up 10 per cent on the previous year.
The bank is attributing its success to its focus on the rural sector, claiming country Australia is being ignored by the big banks.

Milk shortage forces processors to increase prices
Milk shortages caused by dry conditions in Western Australia have forced processors to increase their farm gate milk prices.
The New Zealand-based parent company of Peters and Brownes, Fonterra, has announced a one cent per litre step up for spring.
But Tony Pratico from the WA Farmers Federation says prices need to be substantially raised now.
"I think the processors have to start reviewing it now because the milk's price has to move forward or else on one of the processors here in Western Australia will find themselves without milk," he said.

Wimmera economy hard hit by drought
The lingering effects of the drought and ongoing tough seasonal conditions in Victoria's grain growing Wimmera region are still hitting the region's economy.
The Wimmera Development Association says businesses are feeling the flow-on effects of losing $568 million in grain-related income into the region in 2004.
Chief executive director Phillip Sabien says the situation has not improved for many rural towns.

One in 12 year event behind weather pattern, says forecaster
A one in 12 year weather event is creating an unusually wet winter in the north of Australia but dry conditions in the south, according to a Queensland forecaster.
Dr Roger Stone says the sub-tropical ridge has dropped below the Australian continent to the south of Tasmania this year.
He says it is an important cyclical event which might explain this winter's conditions.
"It's the second most important factor after the El Nino SOI system," he said.
"As people may have noticed it's been way south, it gives us a lot of easterlies or south easterlies on to the Queensland coast , but also tends to bring in a bit more moisture than might normally be the case.
"It tends to get a bit too wet up around Cairns in this type of year, but it can help the situation in central Queensland.

AWB lowers estimated pool returns
Wheat exporter AWB has lowered its estimated pool returns for the coming harvest by $4 a tonne for all wheat grades except durham.
The company says prices have been affected by fluctuating world prices, due to a better forecast for the spring crop in North America.

Rural sector 'can cope' with rate rise
A rural lender says the interest rate rise, announced by the Reserve Bank today, will not cause panic among farmers.
Neil Dobbin, the head of rural banking for Rabobank Australia, says many farmers have already fixed their loan rates and can absorb the rise.
But he says those who have recently acquired a new property or increased their borrowings may feel the pinch.
He also says a dollar at 76 cents US does not help export income.
Mr Dobbin says the main cost concerns farmers have are rising fuel and fertiliser bills.
"I think the rural sector can cope with this rise," he said.
"Seasonal conditions at this stage are generally pretty good, a lot of the commodity prices are in sound position.

Trade policy expert talks up possibility of Japan FTA
An expert on trade policy says the prospects for a lucrative free trade agreement (FTA) between Australia and Japan have never been better.
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer discussed a possible FTA with the Japanese Prime Minister in Tokyo yesterday and both countries are completing a feasibility study.
Dr Ann Capling from Melbourne University is studying the potential benefits of such an agreement, which was flatly rejected by the Japanese Government in 2002.
Japan is already Australia's most important trading partner, but quotas and high tariffs continue to restrict exports of beef, dairy, pork, grains, oilseeds, and fruit, and vegetables.
Dr Capling says there is increasing pressure on Japan to allow more of these supplies in.

US confident of maintaining Iraq wheat market
Iraq is now America's fourth largest wheat customer and the United States sees continued strong purchases in a market once firmly in Australia's court.
Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns was in Baghdad for farm co-operation meetings with Iraqi officials this week.
And despite an expected strong Iraqi wheat harvest this year, Mr Johanns is confident Iraq will continue as a solid US customer.
"We now have about 72 per cent of the market share. To translate that into numbers, that's about 2.3 tonnes in the 05-06 market year," he said.

Online trading opens market to more investors: trader
Day one of online trading at the Chicago Board of Trade has closed, representing a new era for the world's largest commodity trader.
The Board of Trade website says the introduction of electronic trading of agricultural futures contracts is part of its global expansion plans.
Australian trader Corrie Mcgrath says pit traders tend to operate for themselves, while trading online opens up the market to a whole new body of investors.
"Opening up to electronic markets means that a small person can come in through a broker and trade online themselves," she said.

Graincorp to keep some grain receival sites open
Graincorp has agreed not to axe 23 of the 108 grain receival sites earmarked for closure as part of its business rationalisation plan in the eastern states.
Following the announcement of silo closures earlier this year, Graincorp agreed to further negotiation with silo committees, who vowed to fight to keep their local silos open.
The company has confirmed they will keep seven of the 23 sites open for a year in Victoria and three in central Queensland.
It is not yet known what other sites across New South Wales will remain open and how much the move will cost the company.
Graincorp is expected to release further details tomorrow.
In Victoria, the Wimmera has been the most persuasive, saving four of eight sites earmarked for closure.
Ron Jackson, from Patchewollock in the Mallee region, says it is only a 12 month reprieve.

Fox find may prove costly
There is irrefutable proof that foxes are alive and thriving in Tasmania after the discovery of a still warm carcass by a farmer in the Northern Midlands yesterday.
It is believed the animal had recently been hit by a car.
Tasmania has been considered fox free and the pest could cost the state economy $8 million a year if it gets a foothold.
Wildlife biologist Nick Mooney says the fox, a young adult male, was likely to have been born in Tasmania.
He says it is the evidence that will finally silence the sceptics.
"We've had proof for years we believe," he said.
"This is just a most unfortunate and other piece of evidence, so I would have loved to have not seen anything ever again.

Nursery industry loses billions in sales
Queensland's biggest plant-based rural industry is having, by its own admission, its worst year in two decades.
The nursery industry had been worth about half a billion dollars in sales to domestic and export markets a year.
But a drought in the south of the state has cut production and meant a 40 per cent drop in sales to gardeners.
In the north, Cairns nursery operator Daryl Madder says some owners are finding the damage to their stock from cyclone Larry is worse than first thought.
"What we didn't realise at the time was the stock was blown over," he said.

Remote families seek boost in allowances
Families of remote secondary students in the Northern Territory are calling for a higher interstate boarding and travel allowance.
The Federal Government already provides boarding allowances for all isolated children, worth about $7,000 a year.
But Tina McFarlane, from Stylo Station near Mataranka, says the Territory Government should provide extra funds to send isolated children interstate.
She has even considered leasing the station to move the family closer to secondary schooling in Queensland.
"I have a daughter going into secondary school and she has close family in Toowoomba," Ms McFarlane said.
"There are boarding schools in the NT, but it's nearly quicker to go interstate than to Alice and where there is family.

Producers stop culling sheep
Thanks to some much needed rain in Western Australia, producers in Northampton in the state's wheatbelt region have now stopped culling their sheep.
In the northern agricultural regions, around 13,000 lambs and ewes have been destroyed and another 15,000 have died, because the season has been too hard.
Craig Walker from Elders says it is a relief that producers can stop culling, now that there is some green pick around.
"People didn't make that decision light-heartedly," he said.

Egg producers to be audited
Victorian egg producers are stepping up their quality assurance campaign, with a new system to ensure consumers get the egg products they pay for.
Egg farmers producing under the HenCare label will be audited to ensure they meet free-range farming, animal welfare and biosecurity standards.
The president of the Victorian Farmers Federation egg group, Meg Parkinson, says the campaign is designed to eliminate suspicion that egg products are often sold under false labels.
"There has always been a push by some people to say that egg farmers don't do things very well and the eggs in the carton are not the ones they say on the label," she said.

Chlorine used to eradicate exotic marine pest
An exotic marine pest has been eradicated, once again, from boats moored off Darwin Harbour.
The black striped mussel was found on three illegal fishing boats, apprehended in Australian waters.
Peter Zeroni, from the Northern Territory Fisheries Department, says chlorine was used to kill the mussels, but monitoring will continue.
"The vessels were treated in open water by a contractor with AFMA," he said.
"The chlorine we used to treat the vessels obviously affected the mussels. The chlorine will have gone into the woodwork and is likely to kill anything else that's in there.
"So we are pretty confident those boats are safe now. However as a precautionary measure, they will be re-dived every month, any vessels of hulls that are moored in the harbour will be re-dived on an ongoing basis.

Company seeks new growers to help meet demand
A major Victorian company hopes to produce an extra million kilograms of fresh snow peas each year by recruiting new growers in south-east Queensland.
The company, Select Produce, says it has been lured by water security and the favourable climate in the Bundaberg/Childers salad bowl.
The business supplies the two major supermarket chains, with most of its produce coming from Victoria.
But Queensland manager Lyle Wyatt says the company is recruiting growers in the Wide Bay area to help it meet demand all year round.

CDMA network replacement on track: Telstra
Telstra has rejected suggestions the rollout of its new mobile phone network in rural Australia is facing major technical difficulties.
Reports today claim trials of the billion dollar 3G network show the technology is not up to scratch and will not be able to provide the same quality and range as the current CDMA network.
Warwick Ponder from Telstra denies the claims, saying the program is still on track to replace CDMA by 2008.
"We still stand by what we've said all along about this network," he said.
"Today's story in the Australian Financial Review is a bit like speculating about the performance of a racing car before the wheels have even been fitted.

More men call depression hotline
A national hotline to help men in rural areas cope with depression has received 500 calls in its first month.
Chairman of beyondblue Jeff Kennett says 40 per cent of callers have been men, up from just 5 per cent.
Mr Kennett says being able to receive help anonymously from even the most remote areas seems to be making a difference.
"Unfortunately, depression is very prevalent throughout rural Australia and particularly among young men," he said.
"So what we hope with this beyondblue information line is to give men the capacity, wherever and however isolated their environment may be, for the price of a local call to seek direction and help as to what to do in overcoming their depressive illness."

Senate committee examines petrol collusion claims
Widespread rumours of collusion or price fixing between petrol companies will be examined by a Senate committee in Canberra today.
Chairman of the Senate Economics Committee George Brandis says the inquiry will investigate issues that may contribute to high petrol and diesel prices.
Senator Brandis says the main focus will be trying to uncover the truth about collusion.
"What we want to address, in particular, is the relationship between the oil majors and I am not saying that there are any anti-competitive practices, but there has been suggestion of that going back many years," he said.
"But I think the point to be made is that this suggestion has been about for years but it has never been proved.
"The ACCC has examined the matter and it has never found the existence of anti-competitive conduct."
The committee will also look at the financial viability of ethanol and whether fuel taxes should be reduced.

Project aims to boost zinc production at Mt Isa mine
Resources company Xstrata has announced a $160 million project to turn its Mount Isa zinc mine into one of the world's largest.
Fred White, general manager for zinc metallurgical processing, says production will rise from 5 million tonnes a year to 8 million by the second half of 2008.
He says the project also means more jobs for the region.
"We're looking at, for the duration of the project, having up to 200 extra people working in the concentrator providing construction engineering and contracting services, so it's a good story for the area," he said. 

Hunters dismiss fox fight call
A call from the Tasmanian Government for community help to hunt down foxes has been dismissed as a public relations stunt by professional hunters.
With the discovery of a dead fox in the northern midlands a few days ago, the Government wants a task force of more than 100 people to track down the pest.
But Peter Dark from the Field and Game Association says it is an old idea that did not work first time around.
"It's all very well to say 'we'll get a hundred hunters'," he said.

Graincorp to upgrade infrastructure
Eastern states' grain handler Graincorp will spend $25 million on a major upgrade before this harvest.
Most of the money will be spent on better infrastructure at silos, along with appointing grains services managers at the 77 biggest receival sites.

Taiwan market remains closed to cherry growers
Cherry growers locked out of their $7 million market to Taiwan will not be allowed back in this year.
Most mainland regions were banned from exporting fruit in January because growers could not prove their cherries were free of the Queensland fruit fly.
David Minnis from the Cherry Industry Advisory Committee says trials to treat fruit for fruit fly will not finish until January next year.
"It seems a long time away I know, but we've got to wait till the next season to do the full verification trial, then the evidence is written up in a format that we will then submit to the Taiwanese officials," he said.

Draft seed import regulations worry growers
Cut flower growers in northern Australia are renewing their calls for more time to comment on draft changes to seed import regulations.
Biosecurity Australia is reviewing the regulations, which Darwin grower Jan Hintze says will impact on flower breeding.
She says they will also make it harder to conserve species like ginger, which is under threat from timber harvesting across Asia.
"I think it's a significant role that Australia should play within its sphere of interest," she said.
"I mean these people that live in countries in South-East Asia and Asia, they are really concerned about the loss of this material too, but they can't save it all on their own.

Frosty mornings take their toll on wildflower industry
The wildflower industry in Western Australia is the latest sector to be affected by the dry season.
But it is not a lack of rain hampering production.
Frosty mornings are damaging the buds and Rhonda Tonkin of Coomberdale says it is the worst she has seen in 30 years.
Ms Tonkin says she will probably lose some export markets this year.
"If you don't have enough product for the customers they tend to just cancel the container and go to India or somewhere else," she said.
"But we are fairly unique in Australia with our dried flowers and the people are understanding because they know that we have a problem.

Company to streamline Australian operation
Further rationalisation is occurring across the international wine industry.
One of the world's largest international beverage alcohol producers, Constellation Brands, says it will streamline its Australian operation.
Constellation owns the South Australian-based Hardys Wine Company and plans to buyout some grape supply and processing contracts, and sell non-strategic assets.

More innovation needed to overcome wine glut: expert
The marketing sector has been forced to use its imagination to try to shift some of the billion litres of wine in storage across Australia.
One of the latest ideas is a six pack of cleanskin wines in brightly coloured bottles, which have stoppers, so they can be reused as water bottles.
Professor of wine marketing Larry Lockshin, from the University of South Australia, says there needs to be more innovation.
"Right now when you say to somebody 'wine', we think 750 millilitres in a glass bottle with a stopper of some sort, in Australia it might have a screw cap, other places might have a cork or a synthetic," he said.
"But that's a very traditional package, it's been around for hundreds of years, so we haven't been all that creative.
"Look at how you buy milk, how you buy fruit juice, how you buy even tomato paste in the stores. We used to buy it in cans, now you can buy it in tubes like toothpaste.

AWB announces new chief
The head of Orica Mining Services has been named the new managing director of wheat exporter AWB.
Gordon Davis, 50, will replace Andrew Lindberg, who quit at the height of the oil-for-food inquiry earlier this year.
Mr Davis will be paid $875,000 a year, which is less than Mr Lindberg was receiving.
AWB chairman Brendan Stewart says Mr Davis's role will be to stabilise the company and restore its credibility in the aftermath of the Cole inquiry.
"I'm very conscious of the fact that Gordon should not be in any way, shape or form deemed to have been involved in anything that's gone before us at AWB," he said.
"He is new to the organisation, he is a cleanskin in that sense and we look very much forward to him running the business as it goes forward, and essentially the board, and myself, will be dealing with any issues that come out of the Cole inquiry."
Mr Davis will start his role in mid-September.
Meanwhile the Grains Council has written to federal politicians looking for a guarantee that wheat growers will not be lumped with the costs of the Cole inquiry.
AWB estimates the royal commission into alleged kickbacks to Iraq will cost the company between $18 million and $20 million.
The council says current and future profits from wheat sales should not be used to meet the debt.

Coalition MPs pressure Govt over fuel prices
The push is on to find a way to reduce fuel prices with backbenchers pressuring the Federal Government to intervene.
Coalition MPs will meet in Canberra on Monday to put forward ideas to ease the fuel price pain, including more help for the ethanol and biofuels industry, excise cuts and tax concessions for rural and remote areas.
Federal Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane has previously been opposed to extending help to the biofuels sector, but now says it will be considered if it leads to cheaper fuel costs.
"The Federal Government is already providing some assistance to particularly the biofuels industry to get cheaper fuel onto the market and we are disappointed to date that part of that assistance is not actually reaching the motorists, so we'll continue to look at options there," he said.
"I guess Monday's partyroom offers us the opportunity to hear what the backbenchers are suggesting and to consider some further options."
In the United States, the peak body for corn growers in the mid-west believes biofuel production has brought life back to dying farming communities.
Almost 60 million tonnes of grain is processed each year in the United States to make biofuels.
Bruce Stockman from the Minnesota Corngrowers Association says ethanol has delivered a big boost.
"Everyone of the communities that built one of these ethanol plants has come back to life," he said.
"They were on the decline and they have vitality now.
"The dollars that the state gave as an incentive for the first 15,000 gallons of production has paid the state back 16-fold.

Farmers confidence falls
Farmer confidence has fallen due to lower demand, rising costs and poor seasonal conditions between April and June.
The latest agribusiness survey by the National Australia Bank says beef, dairy, wheat, sugar and cotton farmers are less positive about the future.
There is more optimism though for the wool and wine industries.
Analyst Skye Dixon says the good news is that recent rainfall has boosted the price outlook for the next year.
"Over the last 12 months, 2005-06 we saw rural commodity prices rise by around 4 per cent," Ms Dixon said.
"This is largely in line with a steep rise in beef and sugar prices," she said.

Mining companies continue posting profits
Evidence of the resources boom continues to show-up on the financial markets, with record profits posted by Australian miners in the past 48 hours.
The biggest result came from Rio Tinto, which has posted a profit of just under $5 billion for the half year.
Rio produces iron ore, coal, diamonds, copper, alumina and uranium in mining operations around the country.
London resource expert Kevin Tomlinson says the success of Australia's resources sector, despite high labour and operational costs, has surprised world financial markets.

Significant diamond find prompts mining hopes
Diamond mining in South Australia's Flinders Ranges is a step closer after the discovery of 30 diamonds.
Resources company Flinders Diamonds has been exploring the region for the past five years, but this is its most significant find.
Managing director Dr Kevin Wills says other results are yet to be studied, but so far the news is good.
"Each of these samples we're treating has got the chance of being an economic sample," he said.
"Soon as we get to that stage, then we'll convert to doing a feasibility study rather than an exploration program and that's what we trying to find.

Falling wheat crop to blame for AWB share drop
A Western Australian business analyst says AWB's recent share price has been affected more by the falling wheat crop than its new managing director.
The wheat exporter announced yesterday that Orica's head of mining Gordon Davis will replace Andrew Lindberg next month.
Shares in AWB slowly dropped during this week's trade, but gained two cents this morning to hover around $3.74.
Ashley Kelly from Bell Potter Securities says at this time of year the market sharply watches announcements about the grain pool.
"The last update we had on the grain pool was back on the 31st of July, which wasn't very long ago and of course those estimates were lowered," Mr Kelley said.
"If you're a betting person, then you'd probably bet there's possibly another one to come.

Analyst says wool market performing well
Elders says the wool market has performed well against the rising Australian dollar in the first sales after a three-week recess.
The eastern market indicator fell five cents to 741 cents a kilogram this week, with 47,000 bales of wool on offer in Sydney and Fremantle.
In Western Australia the indicator fell by 11 cents to 716 cents a kilogram.
Wool analyst David Fogg says it is surprising there was not a bigger fall, given the two cent rise in the Australian dollar.
"We really thought, particularly at the fine end, that we were going to see at least 20 and perhaps 30 come off prices, but what we saw in fact with the fine wools was 10 to 15 on the first day," Mr Fogg said.

Nine arrested after orchard raids
Fruit orchards in Victoria's Goulburn Valley were searched by police yesterday, resulting in the arrest of nine people on allegations of extortion, arson, drug offences and organised crime.
Charges are expected to be laid today.
Nine orchards were raided yesterday at the culmination of a 12-month undercover police investigation.
Inspector Gerry Ryan says the case relates to standover tactics being used by some fruit growers.

Assistance scheme extended for cyclone-affected growers
The Federal Government will extend a scheme to help north Queensland farmers whose crops were wiped out by cyclone Larry earlier this year.
Employers who qualify receive $200 per worker each week to help them keep staff and skills in the region during the tough recovery period.
Growers were hoping the scheme would run for 36 weeks but at this stage it will be limited to 26.
Denis Rigato's banana and avocado farms were badly damaged by the cyclone and he says any extra assistance is welcome.
"Any sort of help we get is much needed - it's going to help with our existing labour force," Mr Rigato said.
"Even though we've cut back it allows us to keep them [employees] going on, you know more time down the track.

Citrus growers ask for frost assistance
Riverland citrus growers who have had crops decimated by frost have asked the Federal Government for exceptional circumstances assistance.
More than 30 per cent of the region's navel orange crop was ruined during a long spell of frosty weather, with temperatures falling to minus seven degrees.
Peter Walker from the South Australian Citrus Industry Development Board says he has approached Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran with the proposal.
'We effectively have said when we have one crop failure that is a significant and he said it had to be prolonged failure so we're arguing that point of view at the moment," Mr Walker said.

Poppy growers asked to boost production
Tasmanian poppy growers have been asked at the last minute if they can plant an extra 2,000 hectares of poppies.
Pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline announced in April it would cut contracts by 90 per cent because of a world oversupply, but it has now secured a long-term deal that will clear out its reserve stocks.
Spokesman Mike Doyle says the company's relationship with growers may have been damaged, but he hopes they will come to the party.
"The timing's unfortunate I admit," Mr Doyle said.
"We certainly would have liked to have known at a different time of the year, but these sorts of negotiations are very involved and complicated and we are in a position now at least to see if there's ground out there available."

Tomato growers set to profit under new quarantine deal
Australian tomato growers exporting to New Zealand expect cost cuts and increased profits under a new quarantine deal.
The existing inspection regime has been relaxed under an agreement between Biosecurity Australia, the Quarantine Inspection Service and New Zealand authorities.
Exports across the Tasman are worth more than $5 million each year.
Andrew Phillip from Bundaberg-based SP Exports says the new quarantine regulations take effect immediately.

Federal Govt offers $1m to fight foxes
The Federal Government has offered more than a million dollars to fight foxes in Tasmania, as long as the Tasmanian State Government reinstates funding to a fox task force.

Leeuwin II changes young lives in NT
Forty young people from across the Northern Territory now have a career on the high seas in mind after a week at sea.
The group has been aboard Australia's biggest sail training ship, the Leeuwin II.
For 14-year-old Riley Vaughan of Wave Hill Station south-west of Katherine, it was the chance of a life-time.
"How hard it was to work a little sailing ship, I thought I had it tied down, it'd be pretty easy but it wasn't good enough," Riley said.
"I reckon the coils, the knots were the hardest, unfurling the sails, you have to climb up and and crawl out on the end of the sail and unroll it, but it was worth it.
"Everyone once in their life should have a ride on the Leeuwin."

Vaile denies EU claims of bias
The Federal Government has been accused of bias by the European Union by favouring the United States in negotiations for world farm trade reform.
EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson has also snubbed Australia's invitation to attend trade talks in Cairns next month, calling on the Government to stop criticising Europe's farm policy.
But Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile has flatly denied any allegations of bias.
"Well we have always been very ambitious as far as market access on agriculture is concerned and I reject the notion that we are biased towards the United States," he said.
"In fact we are the only country of the six in the G6 that put compromise proposals on all fronts, on market access, on cuts to domestic support and on changes as far as non agricultural market access is concerned.

Farmers want Govt rethink on fuel tax
Farmers who are developing commercial biofuel plants are hoping the Federal Government will rethink its policy on taxing alternative fuels after a meeting of Coalition MPs this afternoon.
Public concern over the high cost of petrol and diesel is expected to be a major issue at the gathering, although Prime Minister John Howard has ruled out cutting the federal fuel excise or subsidies for rural motorists.
Stephen Hobbs from Kaniva in western Victoria says it is time the Government helped the rural community to reduce its dependence on big oil companies.
"I think it's just a really disappointing position that the Federal Government has taken with the whole renewable fuel industry, when you consider that the fossil industry has had 100 years to get it's legislative framework in place," he said.

Calls for former AWB lawyer to be cross-examined
AWB's former in-house lawyer Jim Cooper is likely to give evidence to the Federal Court tomorrow, as the Cole Inquiry seeks access to 1,300 documents that may be relevant to the oil-for-food investigation.
Barristers for the Commonwealth have told AWB they want to cross-examine Mr Cooper, who resigned in April.

South Australian wheat bound for Iraq
Another consignment of wheat bound for Iraq will leave Port Giles in South Australia on Wednesday.
Part of the 350,000 tonne Wheat Australia deal, it is the first wheat from South Australia to leave the port for Iraq in almost two years.
ABB Limited's Maggie Dowling says the 23,000 tonne shipment is big news for the state's wheat industry.

Poor season affects lupin numbers
Western Australian lupin growers are worried that poor seasonal conditions will cut this season's production by two-thirds.
Farmers need to grow enough lupins each year to fill long standing overseas contracts, hold enough over to plant the following year and supply the domestic livestock industry.
With lupins fetching $300 a tonne to meet strong feed demand in the west, Alan Meldrum from Pulse Australia fears there will now be a lack of seed to plant next season.
"It's obviously a very ordinary season, there's not much production going to be happening from lupins in 2006 and the biggest concern is the great northern area where a lot of lupins are produced on an annual basis," he said.

Bid to increase cherry research, development industry fails
Just one vote has defeated a bid by the cherry industry to increase its research and development industry.
Ian Hay from Australian Cherry Growers says the levy rise would have helped to open up export markets in China and Taiwan, by funding a fruit fly program.
He says the industry is now working on an alternative proposal to put to producers.
"It exists now at one cent per kilo, however the conference voted unanimously at executive level to go out in the ballot again, but this time at four cents per kilo," he said.

Mundubberra mandarins headed for China
The first export shipment of citrus fruit to China has left Australia.
Previously fruit entered China through the so-called "grey channel" via Hong Kong.
On Friday a container of honey murcott mandarins from Mundubberra in Queensland's central Burnett region left under China's strict new export protocols.
The shipment will reach Beijing towards the end of the month, meaning fruit supplier Alan Jenkins has a nervous wait.
"We've done everything, we hope, right at this end," he said.
"We've been certified and inspected by AQIS, and we hope that's in line when it gets to China.

$50m for aquaculture, seafood firm
A Western Australian businessman has launched a $50 million buy-up of aquaculture farms in South Australia.
Analysts say the creation of a major seafood company could lead to better prices and major export deals for oyster growers.
The company known as Aqafood has entered contracts to buy several oyster farms on the Eyre Peninsula and an atlantic salmon and ocean trout farming operation in the south-east.
Adelaide business broker Martin White says the venture could see more seafood being sold in untapped export markets.
"It's a progression the industry needs to take, in as much as there isn't a corporatisation at all in a lot of the smaller aquaculture industries and I think to develop and grow the industries this is a positive approach," he said.

Diggers and Dealers conference kicks off in Kalgoorlie
Fifteen hundred miners have travelled from all over the globe to attend the annual Diggers and Dealers talkfest at Kalgoorlie in Western Australia.
The gold mining town is packed to capacity with some of the world leaders in the resource sector, with many delegates having to resort to camper vans and caravan sites for accommodation.
However, talk of moving the conference to a capital city is not being considered by chairman Brian Hurley.
"If it was in Perth or Melbourne or Sydney it would just be another conference," he said.

Comalco port gets $78m upgrade
The mining boom has seen record demand for aluminium, leading to record production of bauxite at Comalco's Weipa mine on Cape York.
After producing 16 million tonnes last year, the company is on track to set a new record. To cope with growing demand, the company has spent $78 million upgrading its port.
The main part of the upgrade is the installation of a second ship loader, which weighs 650 tonnes.
Weipa manager Rob Atkinson says it can fill giant ore ships in no time at all.
"The ship loader is basically a device which allows the bauxite from the stockpiles to be directly loaded into a ship and then it allows the bauxite to be fed into the ship at a rate of about 6,500 tonnes an hour," he said.

Scientist calls on SA farmers to collect rabbit livers
A South Australian scientist is calling on landholders across the country to collect the livers from dead rabbits found on their properties.
In October it will be 10 years since the calici virus was released in South Australia in an attempt to control rabbit numbers.
Ron Sinclair from the state's Department of Water, Land and Biodiversity says the livers will help researchers find out how the virus has evolved and whether it is still effective.
"It's not a very nice thing to do, to chop open a rabbit and take out a bit of liver, but we only need a little piece, about maybe a thumbnail size, chucked in a bottle and thrown into a freezer labelled and then call the local authority responsible for animal or plant control and let them know they have one," he said.

Thousands turn out for bush sports event
While more than 20,000 people are gathering for the annual Darwin Cup today, around 2,000 rolled up for the Hart Ranges bush sports in central Australia over the weekend.
Rodeo, gymkhana, athletics and novelty events like the kangaroo tail toss and lizard racing kept guests entertained, but the big draw card was the amateur horses races.
A young French woman who works in local Aboriginal communities took out the prized events - the Stockman's Bracelet, and the Stockman's Cup.
"I think on the first race, I'm not exactly sure but I was told I had about four lengths before the second horses, and on the second one I was a bit closer to the other horse, I think about two or three lengths as well in front of them," winner Alienor le Gouvello du Timat said.

Concerns over CSIRO, Genetic Solutions deal
There are concerns today that a new commercial relationship between Australia's national science agency and a gene technology company could hurt long-term research projects.
CSIRO has signed an agreement with Brisbane-based Genetic Solutions to become a shareholder in the company in exchange for its research into cattle genes.
Traditionally CSIRO gets royalties and licensing fees for its work.
Mick Keogh from the Australian Farm Institute is worried the deal may change CSIRO's focus, so it is chasing profits rather than undertaking long-term research.
"The New Zealand experience suggests that trying to have public research agencies be very strongly focussed on external earnings targets just diverts the whole thing," he said.
"Everything becomes short-term, the long-term blue sky projects just get left on the shelf and everything's about chasing earnings for this year or next year."

Aussies lose Iraqi wheat trade
A delegation from AWB has travelled to Iraq in an attempt to rebuild the company's damaged reputation.
Figures out of the US suggest it now has 72 per cent of the wheat trade with Iraq, once Australia's biggest grain export destination.
AWB chairman Brendan Stewart says the US is a major competitor and he cannot set a deadline on winning new wheat contracts.
He says the meeting was requested by Iraqi authorities.
"This is an initial re-engagement meeting and is really to talk about process, not to talk about tenders and prices and those sorts of things," he said.
Meanwhile, a group of grain growers - mainly from Western Australia - is investigating possible legal action against AWB.
The WA Pastoralists and Graziers Association says it is researching whether there are irregularities with AWB's incentive scheme.
The group of growers is concerned that $200 million could have been deducted from income that should have gone to growers.
The PGA's Leon Bradley says a legal firm has agreed to act on its behalf to investigate concerns.
"Well our first concern is that the benchmark itself is internally determined by the AWB and we're concerned about its integrity," he said.
"Secondly, with some of the evidence emerging at the Cole commission, we believe some of the prices that have been used to calculate their performance have been inflated."
AWB believes the PGA has misunderstood AWB's incentive scheme.
The company says will try to resolve the issue with the PGA before it embarks on legal action.

Documents decision
The Federal Court has told lawyers for AWB and the Commonwealth to meet privately to cull the controversial list of 1,300 secret documents.
Proceedings have been adjourned until this afternoon so the two parties can agree on a smaller and easier to manage list of communications between AWB and its lawyers.

Beef prices predicted to stay high
The outlook for the cattle industry remains bright, despite the lingering drought and the return of US beef exports to North Asia.
In its latest projections, Meat and Livestock Australia says beef prices should stay at their current high levels because exports and domestic consumption are set to rise.
Chief market analyst Peter Weeks says producers are continuing to pay top prices for grazing land, with production set for a record high next year.
"Rarely seen such a buoyant period, you've really had four or five years where the industry has been what you could describe as buoyant," he said.
"We've had this time round, we've got record prices, we've got near record production and we're thinking by 2:30 we might even have record production.

20,000 sheep up for sale online
The sheep market is strong, with more than 20,000 sheep up for sale on the Internet in Queensland.
That is three times the usual number.
Richard Murray from Landmark at Longreach says most of the sheep offered on Auctions Plus come from properties in western Queensland.
He says graziers are capitalising on strong demand for young ewes from central New South Wales, although abattoir-ready sheep are dominating the market.
"With the processor sheep, usually from mid August the prices tend to ease back a bit, so naturally people are trying to get their sheep onto the market before then," he said.
"It also fits in with the shearings, most of the shearings are done and they're sort of six to eight weeks off the board now, which is an ideal time to be selling the sheep."

Wool growers reject diazinon alternatives
The peak body representing wool growers wants to hold on to access to a common lice control chemical, despite health concerns.
The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority is recommending that diazinon no longer be used to dip or jet sheep.
Wool Producers's Greg Weller wants the authority to consider protective equipment and new methods for dipping, because some of the alternatives create other problems.

Claims grain companies under performing
There are claims today that Australia's key grain companies are under performing on the stock market.
Analyst Paul Jensz from Austock says AWB, ABB and Graincorp are returning between four and six cents for every dollar invested, compared to 10 to 15 cents for other investments.
He says the poor performance cannot be blamed entirely on seasonal conditions, and grower shareholders need to have more trust in external investors and prepare for life without the single desk for wheat exports.
"We would attribute maybe a third of the problem to seasonal issues," he said.
"But we do think even with those issues there is at least 60 per cent, two-thirds of the problem really, attributed towards structural changes in the industry and some problems within particular companies."

High temps hit US dairy farmers hard
A summer heatwave in the United States could be good news for Australian dairy exporters.
Temperatures above 35 degrees have taken a dramatic toll on dairy production in California, with many cows dying.
Dairy analyst Steve Spencer from FreshLogic says production on the west coast could drop by 20 per cent this month.
"California is the largest dairy state and that has a major impact on the industry," he said.
"There has been a cut in production, which will tighten their internal market.

Lack of feed causing sheep to suffer: RSPCA
The RSPCA is cracking down on farmers in WA, saying sheep are suffering due to a lack of feed.
Officers have visited more than 50 farms in the driest parts of the state.
Spokeswoman Emma-Jane Morcombe says the organisation wants to help farmers to find enough feed so their livestock can get through the tough season.
"You can call the RSPCA because we will come in and, as I said, we're giving advice right now," she said.

Murray River system needs 'a lot of rain'
Water inflows to the Murray River system over the past five years have been the lowest on record and this year is shaping up to be another tough one.
With inflows since 2001 at just 40 per cent of the long-term average, Trevor Jacobs from River Murray Water says a lot of rain is needed.
"The catchments aren't responding well yet to rainfall," he said.

Stellar season boosts machinery dealers confidence
One of the best seasons in years in South Australia has machinery dealers confident of big sales at this year's Eyre Peninsula Field Days.
High fuel prices and low commodities have not deterred thousands from attending the biggest event on every farmers calendar in South Australia.
The Eyre Peninsula Field Days plays host to more than 650 sites of large machinery and rural supplies along the outskirts of the small town of Cleve, one-and-a-half hours north of Port Lincoln.
The season in this part of the world has been treated well, with some saying it is one of the best they have seen. Others claim the stem rust could be the downfall of this year's crop.

Kalgoorlie lacking gold treatment facilities, conference told
Treatment mills in Kalgoorlie in Western Australia are working overtime to turn as much ore into gold bars to take advantage of record gold prices.
This week the Kalgoorlie region is hosting the Diggers and Dealers conference, attended by some of the world's leaders in the resource sector.
Analyst Dr Sandra Close has told the conference that local plants cannot keep up with the amount of gold being dug up to ship overseas.
"One of the actual problems we are actually seeing - I guess, in a way, it is a good problem to have - and that is there is a lack of gold treatment facilities in the Kalgoorlie area,' she said.

Divided views on wheat marketing
Four hundred delegates met at the Agriculture Australia conference and all eyes and ears were on a panel session - looking at the future of the wheat industry in the face of AWB inquiry. The key question was should growers retain the single desk, and if so, should they allow AWB to continue to manage it? The Grains Council of Australia, which represents state-based grains bodies, says producers want to keep the systems as it stands until the end of the Cole inquiry. But as pressure mounts from the impending cost of the inquiry, the Grain Growers Association, which represents 17,000 producers on the Eastern seaboard, says there's little choice but to change. So what options should growers go with? On the one side, international traders who want to get a share in the market say growers have nothing to lose. On the other hand, AWB has staunchly defended the benefits of having a single marketer as the best way to maximise returns to growers.

Grain dispute settled out of court
A legal dispute over grain warehoused by Creasy's Grain Enterprises has been settled out of court. When Creasy's collapsed last year, the receiver Ferrier Hodgson cited a 1933 High Court to claim title to a significant tonnage of grain stored under warehouse agreements. The Whillock family from the north-west, with financial and legal support from the Australian Farmers Fighting Fund, challenged that claim in the courts. A settlement of $97,000 has now been reached, returning the full market value of the grain to the Whillock family, plus a large portion of the legal costs. The NSW Farmers Association took up the fight for the Whillock family and the president, Jock Laurie, says although a legal precedent was not set it's still a significant win for the family. Meanwhile, Jackie Whillock has mixed feelings about the case. She's glad that they've received the full value of the grain, but disappointed the 1933 ruling hasn't been overturned.

Live at the Agriculture Australia 2006 conference
Matt O'Sullivan brings you National Rural News today live from the Agriculture Australia conference in Sydney.
MATTHEW O'SULLIVAN: Hello, I'm Matt O'Sullivan, bringing you National Rural News today from the Agriculture Australia conference in Sydney, the peak gathering for the grains industry.
As you'd expect the future of the single desk for wheat exports is a hot topic, and confusion seems to be the common theme.
The future of GM crops is also being debated today and, of course, there's plenty of speculation about whether we'll actually get a decent grain harvest this season - as the ongoing dry drags on, many parts of Australia desperately need follow up rains.
But everybody seems to be talking about alternative fuels, with crude oil prices hitting new highs this week. Delegates believe it's time the Federal Government offered new incentives to make the switch to ethanol and biodiesel.
DELEGATE: "I think there is such an abundance of energy in Australia, you know, they're not very worried about it. They might as well just sit on their arse and not worry about it."
DELEGATE: "We're not getting any results at all with the biofuel. The Government's just not interested to mandate it, and this is not actually going to get off the ground until it's actually mandated, so it's really up to the Government."
DELEGATE: "This issue is now on the table, it's here. And we can't afford to be sitting in here in three years' time not really knowing where we'll be and not picking up on the advantage that is there right now."
DELEGATE: "I fully support the biofuel concept in industry. I disagree with the fact that they'll be getting an excise and I want a level playing field in terms of acquisition of raw material."
MOS: Certainly, there's a feeling that the Government needs to do more, and the grains industry needs to do more as well to get on the front foot and make sure that grain growers have a big slice of this market for grain. There does seem to be a concern that Australia is a long way behind other countries in tapping into the ethanol and biodiesel markets. One of the speakers here today is Terry Reinhart from Advance Trading in the US. Thanks for joining us, can you give us an idea of the industry in the US?
TERRY REINHART: Today, it's about a 4.2 billion gallon industry, which compares to five years ago when it was about a 1 billion gallon industry, and projections are that by 2010 it'll be a 10 billion gallon industry.
MOS: So does a country like Australia have a long way to go to try and catch up to that? Can we catch up to that?
TR: The good news about ethanol is it's a 3000-year-old process by which you take corn and distil it into ethanol, so it's not real rocket science, and if you have the money it's fairly quick to build. You can build a 100 million gallon plant in 15 to 16 months, so it's not like it takes 20 years to develop this thing.
MOS: One of the big concerns here is from end users of feed grain, that it'll be much more expensive and it'll be harder to get access to that grain. How is the corn going into ethanol in the US affected the market there?
TR: To date, there hasn't been any effect on the end user, because corn is still relatively cheap. Today in the US we're over supplied with corn, which is one of the motivators to develop ethanol as a demand for corn, but down the road, as we continue to increase their production, we're going to have to price corn as fuel as opposed to pricing corn as food and the livestock producer is concerned greatly in the US also.
MOS: That, I think, is going to be a growing theme, isn't it, that you have more and more different types of grain going into producing fuel and into producing food, when that's a big issue?
TR: Yeah, it's a big issue, and you can kind of sum up the whole thing if you go back to, I think it was 1998, one barrel of crude would buy 4.7 bushels of corn and today one barrel of crude would buy 30 bushels of corn, so the price relationship strongly favours corn as a fuel as opposed to being a food.
MOS: In terms of the US industry, here in Australia we've got a lot of different plants setting up in small operations. There's no sort of overall structure. Is that going to tell against Australia in the long run?
TR: I don't know. In the US, there's not much structure at this point either. The early people in the ethanol industry were the Cargills and the ADMs of the world. They've been making ethanol for quite some time, but all the new capacity or much of the new capacity is small start-up operations, groups of farmers going together investing in ethanol plants and there's not much organisation today to all the ethanol plants that are out there and time will tell. My guess is some of these plants are built in the right place and some of them aren't, and we'll just have to see over time which ones were built in the right place.
MOS: I see a story quoting Sir Richard Branson saying he's investing in ethanol plants in the US. Are they starting to attract that big business investment?
TR: Yes. Early on, four or five years ago, capital was a problem and you just worked and worked and worked to try and find enough money to build an ethanol plant. To put it in perspective, to build a 100 million gallon plant - which is the one they're building now - it takes about $170 million to build that plant. Whereas five or 10 years ago it was terribly difficult to raise that money, today you're hearing stories of people raising that kind of money in 30 and 60 day periods.
MOS: So there's reason for farmers getting involved in this to have some hope that it will take-off?
TR: In the US, I'd say it has taken off, it really has. And the limiting resource in the US right now is plant capacity. And if we build all the plants that are on the drawing board today, the limiting resource is soon going to become farmland, enough land to produce enough corn to feed the ethanol plants.
MOS: Thanks for your time, Terry Reinhart from Advance Trading in the US.
You're listening to a special broadcast of National Rural News from the Agriculture Australia conference in Sydney.
Of course, alternative fuels hasn't been the only item on the agenda here - an entire session has been devoted to the future of the single desk for wheat exports in the aftermath of the oil-for-food Inquiry.
Reporter Alice Plate sat in on the session - and Alice, what's the feeling about the future of our wheat export system?
ALICE PLACE: Well the feeling has actually changed a bit. In the past, many growers, I think, have tried to separate the single desk issue, that is, AWB's right to veto other exporters' applications to sell wheat overseas, from the ongoing oil-for-food inquiry. And yesterday, at the panel, many of the growers groups admitted that change is now inevitable.
MOS: They're unsure though about what sort of system they want for the future, is that right?
AP: That's right. Looking at the single desk marketing system, it's not simple, by anyone's analysis of it. Breaking it down, you've got on one side the traders, other major competitors - CBH, Graincorp, and the like - all trying to get into that market, saying that they can give growers better returns. And AWB, on the other hand, is saying that it can maximise returns for growers and give them security. But the Grains Council of Australia, which represents state-based grower bodies, says that the majority of growers don't want a change from what they've got. They want AWB to stay there. They want the single desk. On the other hand, the Grain Growers Association, which is east coast grain growers, says growers do want to know more about their options, that they are really starting to question the current system.
MOS: So are they looking for more leadership from the grains bodies?
AP: That's right. We did have a grower stand up yesterday and say, "Why aren't you putting forward options and recommending those to us?" And we have seen the Grains Council of Australia, they have done independent reports, also they've looked at the Victorian Farmers Federation's option for the single desk, but they're saying they're unwilling to analyse and make those recommendations until the Cole inquiry wraps up in September.
MOS: Thanks Alice. Speaking of the inquiry, AWB has told the Federal Court today it will cut by a third the number of documents it's battling to keep away from the Cole inquiry. Lawyers for the wheat exporter have told the court that nearly 400 documents will be struck from the confidential list, leaving 900 still to be contested. And that hearing is continuing in Melbourne.
Here at the conference, reporter Michael Condon has been in one of the GM sessions. What has been discussed?
MICHAEL CONDON: One of the contentious issues surrounding the grains industry always is genetically modified crops, particularly food crops. Today we've heard a couple of distinct points of view expressed. We heard from the the director of scientific affairs for Monsanto. He's actually addressing the conference as we speak now. Bit of a coup for the conference.
He's come from the United States saying that he knows that farmers already support GM crops. He says they get better yields. They use fewer chemicals. They have higher initial seed costs, but those are easily recouped. He's saying thatHe's saying that farmers are in favour. He does concede, though, that there is a bit of a way to go to convince consumers about eating the food that's made from g-m crops. Monsanto, of course, famously put their GM wheat on hold for the time being. He says there are no plans to change that.
But Mr Glick says he's got a strong feeling that consumers will soon be convinced. They'll come to the party, he says. They'll realise that g-m crops can do all sorts of things. They can put in special oils to reduce heart disease. They can have certain complex carbohydrates to combat diabetes, and g-m foods also have less exposure to chemicals in the growing process. So he says he thinks they will be convinced.
MOS: What about the food companies? What do they think about that?
MC: At this stage, George Weston Foods general manager was here as well. He was asked that question. He said at this stage consumers aren't ready. They'd prefer to see the segregation process remain. He was particularly relating to canola. Keep the oilseeds separate that are GM. The other, that's non-GM is used in food. But he said too that he thought that eventually consumers would change their attitudes, and it was up to industry and up to research to try and find ways of promoting health benefits in GM to consumers as well.
MOS: Thanks Michael, reporter Michael Condon here.

Cole inquiry set to resume public hearings
The Cole inquiry into the oil-for-food scandal will resume public hearings in Sydney in less than two weeks after delays caused by a legal challenge to the release of documents.
Board members of wheat exporter AWB could be among those called to give evidence from August 22, although witness details have not been confirmed.

Irrigators fined for stealing water
Two irrigators in south-west New South Wales have been fined for stealing water.
The state's Department of Natural Resources claims a farmer at Euston was found to have extracted more water than he was entitled to, while an irrigator at Barham tampered with a meter on a water pump.
Department spokesman Peter Wells says the breaches were discovered during routine monitoring and prompted follow-up investigations.
"In a drought it's more important than ever that everyone sticks to the rules because the rivers are very stressed the other users are typically on low or nil irrigation requirements," he said.

Wool growers plan ethical wool brand launch
A group of wool growers is planning to launch an ethical wool brand to try to capitalise on consumer demand for environmentally and humanely grown products.
The Australian Wool Growers Association says new branding and marketing innovations are needed to help lift low wool prices and stop the loss of growers from the industry.
Director Will Crozier wants to see all sectors of the growing, processing and manufacturing chain benefit from the brand.
"Our brokers have been talking to people in China and Italy," he said.

Fruit and vegie campaign push gains momentum
An international push to encourage more people to eat fruit and vegetables is gathering momentum.
Backed by the World Health Organisation, the campaign encouraging people to eat two serves of fruit and five vegetables every day is running in 10 countries to try to reduce disease and death rates.
President of the International Fruit and Vegetable Alliance Ron Lemaire says increased consumption will help growers as well as save lives.
"In WA we know that right now there is 97 per cent awareness of the 'two and five' campaign, they have already increased the number of servings by one per day per person, we already see improved health within that community, we already see reduced health care costs," he said.
"The producer also benefits through increased sales.

Wine blueprint to focus on new innovations
New innovations dominate a new seven year blueprint for the Australian wine industry which was launched in Adelaide this morning.
Compiled by the Australian Wine Research Institute, the plan looks at what consumers want from their wine, how growers and wineries can improve production and how to ease the grape glut.
Managing director Sakkie Pretorius says it will help the industry to stay competitive.

Rural commodity price index up 2.5pc
Stronger global commodity prices are helping to offset rising interest rates and the higher value of the Australia dollar.
The Westpac-National Farmers Federation rural commodity price index for July was up 2.5 per cent on the same time last year.
The jump is being attributed to solid demand and dry seasonal conditions in the Northern Hemisphere.
Meanwhile the cotton industry is predicting prices to jump to more than $400 a bale next year due to demand from China.

Surveys to try and identify Timor Sea diamond fields
Oil companies working in the Timor Sea have discovered that there may be diamonds on the Tiwi Islands.
Oil and gas explorers have found evidence of kimberlite, the host rock of diamonds, in the ocean floor west of Melville and Bathurst Islands.
As a result, the Northern Territory's Department of Mines will carry out aerial magnetic surveys of the islands to try to identify new diamond fields.
Richard Brescianini, director of the Northern Territory Geological Survey, dreams of finding a major deposit.

Court dismisses farmer's uranium concerns
A farmer at Esperance in Western Australia is fighting to stop uranium exploration on her property.
Yvonne Hallam took court action this week to try to stop the exploration application but her case was dismissed.
She says she is worried about biosecurity problems from letting people on to her land.
"I think we've got the right to continue with the farming that we've been doing for probably 40 years, and people before us, and people after us without having to worry about who's coming and going, and opening, and shutting gates, or maybe not shutting gates and all that sort of thing," she said.

More women entering mining workforce
The resources boom has led to a more women enter the mining workforce across Australia.
More than 3,500 women have started work on mine sites over the past three years and now make up 18 per cent of the workforce.
And Mitch Hooke from the Minerals Council says the trend will have to continue to make up for a severe shortage of workers.
"They are attracted by pay, yes they are attracted by the opportunity but they've started to see that the macho image of the mining industry is not quite as stringent as it was," he said.
"Don't forget women make the best truck drivers.
"I mean we've got a couple of mine managers that are women, we've got an Indigenous female mining engineer.

Bull sale 'solid'
It was a big day in Broome in northern Western Australia yesterday, with Ladies Day at the races and the annual bull sale.
One hundred and thirty-six beasts went under the hammer, with a Kimberley pastoralist paying the top price of $4,500 for a brahman bull.
Tony Cooling from Landmark Broome says the sale was solid, without being outstanding.
"We had a very very good clearance, the average was slightly up on last year so both the vendors were smiling and the purchasers all got the fair share of bulls," he said.

NSW producer's cattle sets record price at Ekka
A New South Wales beef producer has had a very successful trip to the Ekka in Brisbane.
After a 12 hour drive from Singleton, in the Hunter Valley, Greg Ball has scored wins in three of the four categories of the lead steer competition at the annual agricultural show.
And the auction of his winning prime cattle, set a record price.
"Twenty-seven dollars a kilo for the champion steer - I think that'd be the most money we've ever received for a steer at a competition and I think some people are claiming it as an Australian record, I don't know," he said.

Tassie camembert takes out world cheese award
A Tasmanian camembert has beaten the country that invented it at a world cheese show in the United States.
The winning sample from the National Foods' cheese factory in Burnie was up against 100 entries from all over the world, including the best from France.
Chuffed cheese maker Kurt Wyss says the Tasmanian Heritage Signature Camembert is unlike any other in the world.
"It really stands out compared to other camemberts as the flavour is a more fuller, earthier and a really, really creamy texture," he said.

Govt accused of sitting on oil review
The Democrats have accused the Federal Government of failing to force the major oil companies to meet their biofuels targets.
The party believes the Government is sitting on a review which reveals the oil companies are less than halfway towards meeting their target of selling 350 megalitres of biofuel by 2010.
Nationals Senator Ron Boswell also believes the oil retailers are not making a big enough effort to adopt alternative fuels.
"I know fairly closely that from the time the Prime Minister called the oil companies in, the oil companies promised the Government that they would sell 89 million litres this year, we're now almost in September and I would expect they've sold about 10 million litres," he said.
"Now that is not honouring the commitment to the Government ... and they need to be brought to account."
The Federal Government has defended the oil companies, saying they are on track to reach the target.
Meanwhile the nation's peak motoring body says fuel prices could surge to a $1.80 a litre by the end of the year.
Alan Evans from the Australian Automobile Association says there has been trouble in the Alaskan oil fields, Nigeria and the Middle East which makes us vulnerable to a price increase:

Forrest defends decision to abstain on migration Bill
Former National party chief whip John Forrest says his decision not to support the Federal Government's controversial migration legislation is based on his personal experience of refugees' contribution to rural Australia.
Mr Forrest resigned from the position yesterday after abstaining from the vote on the plan to detain and process all asylum seekers offshore.
The Victorian-based member for Mallee says he has supported the visa cases of asylum seekers working in horticulture and local abattoirs and has visted others in detention.
"We have literally got thousands of refugees living amongst us, more particularly along the Murray Valley but they are spread right across the electorate," he said.
"When people meet these folks and listen to their story, their perception about them changes.

Biodiesel price cut unlikely
The country's biggest oil refiner says it will not be offering incentives for biodiesel to match its announcement to make ethanol cheaper at the pump.
Under a new program, Caltex and BP will offer ethanol-blended fuel at three cents per litre less than regular unleaded fuel.
Caltex government affairs manager Frank Topham says biodiesel is too expensive to cut prices for motorists.
"Biodiesel is significantly more expensive than ethanol for us to purchase, for the producers to produce and therefore a three cents a litre discount will not be possible," he said.
Caltex has also rejected claims that it is not buying fuel from the county's biggest biofuels producer.

Govt lawyers seek access to secret AWB documents
Lawyers for the Federal Government are fighting for access to a handful of secret AWB documents which it claims involve possible fraud.
In submissions today, counsel for the Commonwealth, Ian Harrison SC, told Justice Neil Young in the Federal Court, the selected material must be released to the Cole inquiry, even if it is privileged because it indicates evidence of possible fraud.
Mr Harrison said AWB inflated its wheat price to pay Tigris $8 million, with part of this money being used to pay $2 million in compensation to Iraq for iron filings contamination in wheat shipments.
Mr Harrison said this was a clear breach of UN sanctions and fraudulent.

Third party to oversee NLIS audit
The Federal Government will appoint an independent third party to oversee an audit of the National Livestock Identification System database to address cattle producer concerns once and for all.
The Australian Beef Association lobby group feared the audit would be conducted in-house,and not effectively address its claims that the electronic livestock tagging system is not working effectively.
But Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has released the terms of reference for the 10 week audit and says he is just about to appoint a major accounting firm to run it.
He says every major group will have a say.
"The Australian Beef Association will be contacted and their concerns will be completely and fully explored," he said.

Wool growers urged to keep research levy
Wool producers are being urged not to lodge a protest vote against maintaining the 2 per cent levy which funds research, development and marketing by Australian Wool Innovation (AWI).
With plans afoot to merge AWI with Australian Wool Services (AWS), some growers are worried their funds will be used to pay a $27 million debt owed by AWS in the United Kingdom.
Chairman of WoolPoll 2006 John Keniry understands growers are hurting from the drought and low wool prices, but says cutting the levy will create new problems.
"Zero per cent means that there is no levy income," he said.
"If there is no levy income from growers then there is also no contribution from the Federal Government and that means there is no ongoing income for AWI.
"AWI would spend the reserves it has simply to finish off the contracts that are currently in place and then turn out the light, which, from my personal view as a wool grower, would be a sad event if we just walked away from research altogether."
The WoolPoll vote closes on November 3.
The wool market remained steady this week, the eastern market indicator up just one cent to 742 cents per kilogram.
The market remained unchanged in the west.

New regulations restrict animal health work to vets
Under proposed new animal welfare regulations in New South Wales, a range of routine animal health procedures will be restricted to vets.
From September 1, vets will be responsible for dehorning cattle, and mulesing sheep over a year old, and castrating cattle, sheep and goats over six months of age.
The new regulations also classify most equine dentistry as veterinary science, limiting equine dentists to basic teeth cleaning and rasping.
Master equine dentist and trainer Ian Wharton says the regulations will be devastating.

Sunbeam won't renew currant contracts
Australia's largest dried fruit processor says it will not renew or issue new contracts for currants.
Murray Valley growers have received falling returns for the past six years, raising questions about the industry's viability.
Under existing contracts Sunbeam Foods will still have to accept 3,500 tonnes of fruit this year, but spokesman Chris Ellis says the global market is oversupplied and it is hard for Australia to compete.
"I think we were hopeful that the Greek crop might be diminished this year or that some sort of political trading resolution would have come and the situation would have eased," he said.
"For those growers impacted they've got to find another opportunity.

Wine expert predicts grape glut's end
A leading wine authority says Australia's grape glut will soon be over and it is nothing to worry about.
Author of the Wine Atlas of Australia James Halliday says boom and bust cycles are a normal part of agriculture.
He says like sugar, wine will revive.
He has played down the fact that up to 100,000 tonnes of grapes were left unpicked in the last Australian harvest.
"That's still only 5 per cent of the total potential harvest, so it's by no means as dramatic as the headlines would have you believe," he said.

Aust firefighters help battle US blazes
A team of 47 Australian and New Zealand firefighters have flown to the United States to help battle some of the worst summer wildfires in more than a decade.
The crew is on a four-week deployment in the western part of the US, where more than 40 fires are burning.
Jeff Pike from Victoria's Department of Sustainability and Environment says Australian firefighters will have to work in unfamiliar conditions.
"Most of their fuel is soft wood fuel systems, pine spruces and fuel like that," he said.
"The elevations they operate at are a little higher than here.

Qld's finest cattle on show at Ekka
The who's who of Queensland's cattle industry is at one place today - at the Brisbane Ekka.
The Ekka is playing host to one of the nation's most prestigious cattle competitions.
The cattle are bringing good prices at today's auction.
Numbers are down a little at the Ekka prime cattle competition this year, numbers of cattle that is, but there are certainly plenty of people.
Between 200-300 have gathered around to hear how much Queensland's meat processors are prepared to pay for the cream of Queensland's fat cattle.
Already the grand champion pen of six limousin, exhibited by Eddie Nolan from southern Queensland, has made 250 cents per kilogram liveweight.
Grand champion steer of the show, another limousin, made 305 cents a kilo.

Noxious weed found to benefit salmon
A Tasmanian scientific researcher is turning one of Australia's most noxious weeds into beneficial omega-3 oils.
Matthew Miller has found that feeding pattersons curse, or salvation jane, to salmon significantly increases their levels of the healthy oils.
Mr Miller began using oil extracted from the weed as fish food after identifying the particular compounds needed to stimulate omega-3 production.
"Patterson's curse have this really unique special oil and pattersons curse has the highest level of this oil," he said.

Snowy River to reap benefits of western water project
A big water-saving project is being officially opened in western New South Wales today, with benefits for the iconic Snowy River.
The $28 million redevelopment of the Barren Box Swamp near Griffith will save 20 gigalites of water.
It is one of the biggest projects funded under the New South Wales, Victorian and Federal Governments program to boost flows in the Snowy.
Murrumbidgee Irrigation chairman Dick Thompson says a natural wetland on the site is also being restored.
"We've already seen a lot of the bird life return," he said.

Rural youth forced to travel for abortions
A new study has found teenagers in country Australia are travelling up to 100 kilometres to have abortions in the cities, because of a lack of services.
The report has been published today in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health.
Co-author Carolyn Nickson, from the University of Melbourne, says almost one in five teenagers are leaving their regional towns to access termination services.
"Eighteen per cent of teenagers had travelled over 100 kilometres, 28 women in our sample had travelled from interstate," she said.
"Twenty of those were from New South Wales and 10 of those were from the Albury region.

Cowra Abattoir in receivership
The abattoir at the centre of a row over the Federal Government's new industrial relations laws has been placed into receivership.
Two hundred workers were locked out of the Cowra Abattoir in New South Wales this morning, and meat supplies to local butcher shops were suspended.
The plant hit the headlines earlier this year when management sacked 29 workers under the IR laws, and offered to rehire them on different conditions.
Charlie Donzo, from the Meat Employees Union, says a new workplace agreement had been developed, and he is surprised and disappointed.
"This is absolutely devastating, not only for myself but for the workers at Cowra," he said.
"Given the problems we have had over the last three or four months, and the efforts that the fellows have put into putting in a new agreement in place to make the plant more efficient and that.

Shipment fodder blamed for livestock deaths
The use of new fodder on four live sheep shipments last year is being blamed for a slight rise in livestock death rates.
Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) and Livecorp figures show small increases in mortality rates for sheep and cattle during 2005, and a slight fall in goat deaths.
Out of 4.2 million sheep exported last year, 0.95 per cent died.
MLA general manager Mike Hayward says that was largely due to the fodder, which was less dusty but contained less fibre and nutrients.
"It essentially led to an increase in mortalities because a more than normal number of the sheep failed to eat," he said.
"There was a higher level of disease in the animals as a result of that lack of fibre.
"It was as simple as that."

Single desk changes 'would hit AWB shares'
Investment banker JP Morgan says shares in wheat exporter AWB could drop to $2.80, if the company loses control of the single desk for wheat exports.
Shares fell last week to $3.36, which is lower than the company's debut price on the Australian Stock Exchange.
An analysis by the banker also shows that AWB's share value would hover around $4 a share if it held onto the single desk but more competitors were allowed to sell wheat overseas.
Greg Canavan, a senior equities analyst from Fat Prophets, says that is not surprising given AWB's experience in wheat sales.
"When you look at the whole structure of the market AWB, given its monopoly position, does have a very big market share," he said.
"If it didn't have to give that market share up then it would still be in competition with the other players coming in.

US wheat forecast continues to drop
The US wheat production forecast continues to slide but there has been a sharp rise in grain prices.
The latest US Agriculture Department wheat estimate is off another 5 million bushels from last month at 1.8 billion.
But that is just a small decline compared with the 14 per cent drop so far from the last marketing year.
USDA's World Agricultural Outlook Board chairman Gerald Bange says the bigger story is a 20 cent price increase on tightening competitor production in Argentina, Canada and the EU.
"EU-25, in particular, was down pretty sharply," he said.
"We can down 6.8 million tons on our estimate of their 06/07 crop and the reason for that is they were hit really hard by some real extreme heat in June and July."

Farmers fear further chemical bans
Farmers are worried the Federal Government will ban access to more chemicals commonly used in agriculture, in response to last week's terrorism arrests in the United Kingdom.
Some say restrictions on the ammonium nitrate fertiliser have made the chemical prohibitively expensive.
The Victorian Farmers Federation says the future of another 84 fertilisers, herbicides and fumigants is being considered by the Government.
Spokesman Geoff Kendall says because farmers already have to obtain training certificates for many of the chemicals, the Government should not over-react.
"We understand it will be the farmers won't have access to these products," he said.
"Basically they'll be banned from using them in the future so we're very very concerned.

World Bank urges seasonal work visas for islanders
The World Bank has backed farmers' calls for unskilled Pacific Island workers to fill labour shortages in Australia.
The Federal Government has previously rejected any changes to the visa scheme which allows skilled migrants into the country
But the bank says the Government could introduce a pilot program, allowing islanders to spend part of the year working in seasonal labour jobs.
Senior economist Manjula Luthria says the the islanders need the work or some Pacific economies could collapse.
"Forty per cent of the population are youth and in less than 10 years from now, they're going to want to be making the transition from working basically off the land to paid employment," he said.
"A small percentage are actually going to find it domestically.

Supply increase slashes macadamia prices
An increased world supply has cut the price of macadamia nuts by almost half and investors are counting the cost.
Up to 20 per cent of macadamia farms have changed hands in the past two years, due to strong demand and sustained industry growth.
But Andrew Heap, from the Australian Macadamia Society, says increasing fuel costs and mortgage repayments has now hit consumer demand.
He says over-investment on some farms will create problems.
"Most of those investors have been in a financial position to pay more than the agricultural value say these farms are worth," he said.

Cattle TB surveillance program nears end
After more than 30 years, the tuberculosis surveillance program for cattle will wrap up at the end of this year.
The nation-wide program has been monitoring the health of cattle in northern Australia since 1970.
The chief veterinary officer in the Northern Territory, Brian Radunz, says it is seven years since tuberculosis was detected there, and he is 99.9 per cent certain it has been wiped out.
"Due to the nature of TB you can always have a infection hidden out there but it's very unlikely given the fact that for the last 10 or so years if we have found infection we have been removing all the animals that have been exposed to that infected animal," he aid.
"So unless there's some undetected infection around we should never detect it.

Logging detrimental to possums' sex life: study
The results of a five-year study claims farming and logging is having an impact on the sex life of possums.
The mountain brush tail possum of north-eastern Victoria has been in the spotlight, and found to only have one mate in areas which have been cleared.
Professor Jenny Martin, from the University of Melbourne, says monogamy is rare in mammals, and it is occurring because there are fewer trees for sleeping and eating.
"But at the other site where there was heaps and heaps of large trees with hollows, huge amounts of food trees and most importantly that those two types of trees were very close to one another, females could have extremely small home ranges while still getting access to the same amount of resources in terms of food and shelter," she said.

Rain cheers Louth race goers
Recent rain was a reason to celebrate at the 48th annual Louth races in western New South Wales over the weekend.
After almost a decade of drought, the red dust has been replaced by a blanket of green.
About 4,000 people flocked into Louth and committee president Tess Le Leviere says the rain made a difference.
"People started working about two months ago on the different jobs and they get together at the pub and talk about it and by the time it is the day there's been a lot of excitement and people forget just for a little while their problems," she said.
"We've been very lucky because we've have three inches - nearly four - of rain over the last six weeks and everything's very green.

First independent sugar shipment leaves Cairns
The first shipment of sugar from two Queensland mills operating outside the industry's single desk has left Cairns bound for China.
Queensland Sugar Limited's monopoly on export sales has ended under deregulation, with the Mossman and Mulgrave mills deciding to join the trade.
Worker Barry Donnelly was at the Cairns sugar terminal to watch the 24,000 tonnes of sugar being loaded.
"This will take about 17 hours to load this ship - there are five holds on this ship and they will just about be filled to capacity," he said.

Australian judge makes mark on English show
An Australian cattle breeder has made his mark in England, after being invited to judge at the prestigious Great Yorkshire Show.
Rod Summers, who owns Maranga Stud at Evandale in Tasmania, was the mandatory independent judge of the belted galloway breed.
In true Australian style he managed to ruffle a few feathers before proving he knows his stuff about the British breed.
"A lady took me to task [about] why she was placed fourth instead of third after I swapped them, before I ordered the ribbons," he said.
"Anyway, then she explained to me how the beast I'd placed third she'd sold last year and the beast I'd placed fourth was the one she'd kept.

Demand fuels lobster breeding research
Australian marine scientists are trying to farm tropical lobsters, in a bid to meet the insatiable appetite of the Chinese.
China is prepared to pay $30 a kilogram and demand cannot be met from wild stocks.
Mike Hall, from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, says the biggest challenge to farming lobster is overcoming the disease problems which kill young larvae.
"If we can get these animals from eggs through the larval phase and through the grow out phase to harvesting in a very short time, or in a short time, you're going to have a higher profit margin than one that takes extremely long," he said.

Cannery wins US export deal
Australia's last tuna cannery has secured a $40 million export deal with the United States.

Growers urged to aid canker-hit farms
Australian Citrus Growers wants members to donate money to help colleagues in central Queensland affected by the canker outbreak.
More than half-a-million trees were destroyed following the detection of the disease near Emerald in July 2004.
The Queensland and Federal governments are footing 80 per cent of the bill but industry needs to contribute about $200,000.
President Mark Chown is hoping other regions will help out.
"People can contribute as much as they wish," he said.
"We understand times are very tough for all growers at the moment, however, these people have had their entire orchards removed.
"Looking out the back door there's nothing, so we're very concerned about that and this project was put forward and we've been eager to be involved."
And as the winter citrus season wraps up in the Riverland and Sunraysia, fruit exports to China are looking shaky.
Growers have gained official access to the country but they are worried about a tough quarantine protocol to keep the pest, fuller's rose weevil, out of China.
The Federal Government has rejected calls to underwrite the initial fruit shipment.
But Andrew Green, from SA's Citrus Industry Development Board, has not given up hope.

WA pushes for federal drought relief funds
The West Australian Government will apply for exceptional circumstances (EC) relief for some of the state's worst drought-affected regions.
It is in negotiations with the Federal Government to roll over an existing EC claim in the northern agricultural region but extend it further into the central wheatbelt.
Dexter Davies, from the Dry Season Advisory Committee, says parts of the state are the worst he has seen anywhere in Australia.
"It's the driest start in history," he said.
"In the northern areas ... all chances are gone.
"Mullewa, Morowa, through there, it simply hasn't rained and that goes right out to the coast to Northampton - up there they just simply haven't had a winter at all.

Farmers welcome migration Bill's collapse
Farmers are among those who have welcomed the Federal Government's decision to abandon its proposal to detain and assess all asylum seekers offshore.
Prime Minister John Howard has withdrawn the legislation because the Government did not have the numbers to get it through the senate.
Ian Skiller says 90 per cent of the asylum seekers he employs on his farms at Tooleybuc, in north-west Victoria, are farmers who lost their own properties in the Afghan war.
"The thing that annoys me is that they have knowledge of horticulture and farming and it seems a waste that we're not utilising those skills," he said.
"I think they're an asset to the area.

Govt to hear farmers' chemical access concerns
The Federal Government says it will listen to farmer concerns before deciding whether to restrict access to more agricultural chemicals in the wake of the latest terrorism threat.
There is currently a review of 84 herbicides, fungicides and fumigants.
Farmers are worried that a new licensing system being considered by the Government will make the chemicals too expensive.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says there needs to be a balance between security concerns and farming needs.
Ben Fargher, from the National Farmers Federation, is hopeful the Government can be persuaded to keep existing training and certification programs instead.
"We will sit down with government, we will explain how the current schemes work with government," he said.
"There is government involvement in this and government people I have spoken to are aware of the industry schemes.

BJD trace proves NLIS's worth: vet
The Queensland Government has rejected criticism of the National Livestock Identification System (NLIS), after using it for the first time to track six potentially diseased cattle across three states.
The system, which aims to achieve whole-of-life traceability, has been accused of being inaccurate and costly, and is now subject to an independent audit.
But Queensland's principal veterinary officer, Dr Rick Webster, says the system has been used to trace cattle from a herd diagnosed with Bovine Johnes disease (BJD), avoiding a costly eradication program.
"Because of NLIS we were able to check the records and see that all six animals had all been slaughtered and they had only spent time alive in feedlots," he said.

Middle East unrest hits cattle exports
The conflict in the Middle East is affecting some sectors of the live export cattle trade.
Israel is a consistent buyer of large bulls from the Kimberley in far north Western Australia.
But over the past month, inquiries have eased and prices have dropped 20 to 30 cents a kilogram.
Elders livestock agent Kelvin Hansey says the instability between Israel and Lebanon has hurt the small bull market.
"I mean it's a 30 per cent drop in the price already, and has the potential though to stop for several months," he said.
"They are big events, these international events.

Abattoir's closure hits lamb prices
Livestock prices in New South Wales have reacted to the closure of the Cowra Abattoir, with lamb prices falling $3 to $4 a head.
An administrator was appointed and the abattoir's operations were shut down yesterday.
Management claims the meatworks had been losing between $30,000 and $50,000 a week.
Chris Grove, from the New South Wales Sheep Meats Council, is concerned that there is one less buyer in the market.
"What it will probably mean will be a downturn in competition," he said.
"One less buyer means less competition but it is just to be hoped that there is enough competition in the market.
"A big problem we are facing in the industry, all the meat industry and the sheep industry, is the reduction in kill capacity.
"Of course this has been made worse by closure of Cowra Abattoir.

Cattle feedlot to host ethanol plant
International investment firm Babcock and Brown is planning to build a $120 million ethanol plant at a cattle feedlot in southern New South Wales.
The proposed facility at Rockdale Beef at Yanco will produce up to 150 million litres of ethanol a year, and the grain by-product fed to the cattle.
Rockdale's general manager Paul Trojah says the ethanol production will complement the feedlot's plans for a biogas plant to generate electricity from cow manure.
"Rockdale Feedlock will be producing about five megawatts of energy a day from all of the waste streams," he said.

Farmers question fuel package benefits
The Federal Government has pumped $1.5 billion into a plan to tackle high fuel prices, but there are questions over whether the farm or transport sectors will benefit.
Almost half of the package will cover the cost of converting and installing LPG tanks.
Grants of up to $2,000 for the conversion are available immediately.
But it is not expected to benefit farmers because it only applies to private users, and most farmers use machinery run on diesel, which cannot be converted to LPG.
There are also concerns conversions will be delayed because of a huge demand and limited resources.
A three-year program to help service stations adopt equipment to sell ethanol-blended fuel, has also been announced.
But the biofuels industry would have preferred a mandate for ethanol-blended fuel and more pressure on oil companies to buy ethanol.
The Federal Government will also spend $123 million to encourage people to use wind and solar power over generators in remote communities.
There is $76 million to encourage more oil exploration.

Fishing industry
The fishing industry says the fuel package is of no assistance.
Neil Green, from the Queensland Seafood Industry Association, says primary producers have been hoping for excise cuts to reduce fuel costs.
"I don't think politicians, in particular the Prime Minister, actually realises where the fishing industry is," he said.
"Financially we're on a knife's edge and fuel is our big cost.

Fines for minor breaches may exacerbate driver shortage problem
Livestock transport operators are concerned that new fatigue management measures proposed by the National Transport Commission could force drivers out of the industry.
The commission's proposal to improve driver fatigue suggests a demerit system for log book offences, the same system used for general traffic offences.
Ross Fraser from Frasers Transport in Queensland says while road safety is paramount, the shortage of drivers will get worse if they start being fined for minor breaches.
"We're really concerned about it because we're getting drivers who are at the moment being fined for 15 minutes over in their log book - 15 minutes over a driving period that may have happened three weeks ago," he said.

ACCC recommendations threaten phone rental parity
The cost of phone line rentals in regional Australia could rise dramatically if the Federal Government accepts new recommendations from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).
Telecommunications consultant Gavin Priestley says the ACCC has recommended a wholesale line rental of $7.00 a month for CBD customers, but $34 for major regional centres.
He says that means rental costs for lines in smaller communities could rise much higher.
"What it signals is the average of the access prices for telephones right across Australia is going to change and our worst fears potentially are going to be realised," he said.
"That is country people will not get parity and will pay more for access to their phone line.
"When the sale of Telstra was touted we were guaranteed that we would get parity of price and future proofing of the service. This is certainly not parity."
The National Farmers Federation (NFF) says it is concerned and seeking more detail from the Communications Minister.

US grain growers anxious to control ethanol plants
Australian investment in US ethanol plants is causing a stir among US grain growers, who are anxious to hold onto control of their new industry.
Mid-west US producers said at a farm bill listening session they are concerned foreign investors that Wall Street might gain too much control of US ethanol production.
National Farmers Union president Tom Buis says "it's been a 30-year struggle, basically by farmers to get this industry kick-started. And now that it's arrived, they just don't want to sit back and watch the control and all the profits go elsewhere".

Sugar prices drop
World sugar prices have fallen below 13 US cents a pound, down from a high of more than 18 cents earlier this year.
It is bad news for Australian growers, who are about halfway through the harvest and had been hoping for a breakthrough season.

Labor claims underdog status in Qld election
Water and health are expected to dominate the Queensland state election, set for September 9.
It is 65 years since a Labor government won a fourth term in office in Queensland.
But despite holding 60 of the 89 seats in State Parliament the party is claiming underdog status, in part because its lost the last three by-elections and at least 10 sitting members, including a number of ministers, are not contesting this poll.
The Liberal Party has a new and untested leader who has been in the job for less than a week and the Coalition needs to win 22 seats to take office.
The key issues are the water crisis in the south-east and the stressed health system statewide.
The Premier says his plans for a south-east water grid and a $9 billion injection into health over the coming years will solve the problems.

Farmers urged to lobby for weed bio-control programs
Scientists are calling on farmers to lobby for more natural ways to control weeds.
The Co-operative Research Centre for Weed Management says the use of bugs and diseases to control invasive plants over the past 100 years has provided $10 billion worth of environmental and agricultural protection.
Despite criticism that natural control methods are too slow and unreliable, Dr Rachel McFadyen says the new research suggests previous efforts have prevented invasive plants from wrecking the environment.
"What we're saying to farmers is if farmers have got a significant problem year after year then they should be asking their agriculture representatives and their state government members, is there a bio-control program against this weed?" she said.
"And if there is, does it have enough funding to get it going and if there isn't why is there one?
"Because it's one of the best returns on money that they can get."
Meanwhile large tree cropping companies in Western Australia are opening their gates to agist sheep from drought-stricken farms.
Integrated Tree Cropping has 70 plantations in the state's south-west and wants to use sheep to control weeds.
Spokesman Andy Wright says it should help the company too by saving thousands of dollars a year on pesticides.
"We would have to carry out management on those weeds," he said.
"We'd have to spray the weeds within the plantation or we would have to slash round the outside of the plantation.

Wool bodies launch national mulesing assurance program
The wool industry's peak bodies have launched a national mulesing assurance program to try to reassure wool processors that animals are being treated humanely.
Australian Wool Innovation and Wool Producers will improve training for 1,200 mulesing contractors by the end of the year to minimise pain and suffering for animals.
Under the practice of mulesing, skin is cut from the backside of lambs to reduce the risk of flystrike.
Secretary of the program, Charlie De Fegely says the wool industry wants to show it has ethical standards.
"I've even heard of some contractors paying for their producers to do it simply because they want to have best practice and they don't want to be part of holding the industry back," he said.

Wool growers want to postpone wool levy vote
The Australian Wool Growers Association will ask the Federal Government to delay an industry vote on the future of the wool levy.
This year's Woolpoll is asking growers to support an ongoing 2 per cent levy to fund research, development and marketing by Australian Wool Innovation (AWI).
But with AWI planning a merger with Australian Wool Services, the association's Martin Oppenheimer says growers need more information about the new organisation before they can make a decision.
"At the moment in the current climate there's no way that wool growers are going to be able to afford extra levies," he said.
"What they want to be able to do is to split their levies between research and marketing.

Green light given to third poppy processor
A third poppy processor has been given the green light by the Tasmanian Government.
TPI Enterprises has been permitted to manufacture and sell narcotics from a small trial plot, but managing director Jarrod Ritchie says it is a significant step.
He is hoping to lock in future orders, despite a world oversupply of poppy-derived products.
"There is price pressure on morphine, I don't think anyone's denying that," he said.
"Countries like Turkey are sitting on significant stockholds but we see our main focus as being thebaine and we're very confident of getting those markets.

Mystery virus wipes out flying foxes
The skies around the Northern Territory town of Katherine have been clearer over the past 10 months, due to a mystery virus that is wiping out large numbers of native 'little red' flying foxes.
While the mammal is considered a pest to farmers and townsfolk, the scientific community is concerned the ecological system will suffer from a 50 per cent reduction in flying fox numbers.
Andrew Pickering from Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife says no one knows what impact the fall in numbers will have.
"There's possibly a roundworm and a virus, not knowing exactly what to pinpoint," he said.
"Flying foxes are actually a huge ecological benefit to the bush around here as pollinaters and seed distributors and so the loss of those big mega colonies that we typically have they can number up to hundreds of thousands have disappeared at least from the Katherine region."
Meanwhile for the first time all efforts to manage the fruit fly are being recorded in a national stocktake.
It is looking at surveillance, research and development, market access and trade, and quarantine inspections.

Farmers hail success of tuna trial program
Tuna farmers are hailing the success of a trial program to catch fish all year round.
To test growth and health levels, 65 tuna have been held in cages off Port Lincoln in South Australia for the past 17 months which is four times longer than usual.
The fish were harvested yesterday and David Ellis from the Tuna Boat Owners Association says they were in excellent health.
"We're going to get the weight and the length of the fish, to see
how much they've grown," he said.
"We've also taken product quality samples or flesh samples so we're looking at how long or how red it stays for in shelf life.

ACCC recommendations threaten phone rental parity

The National Farmers Federation (NFF) says it is concerned and seeking more detail from the Communications Minister.
But chief executive Ben Fargher says he is confident rural line rentals will remain capped, under what is says is an "iron clad" deal between the NFF and the Government.

The new national agreement to handle exotic pest and disease outbreaks is being questioned, after a decision to withdraw financial support for Queensland's attempts to control sugar cane smut.
The fungal disease, sugar cane smut, was first discovered in south-east Queensland just over two months ago and since then more than 50 properties have been put under quarantine, disrupting harvest and putting strict protocols on local growers.
As a signatory to the new Emergency Plant Pest Response Deed under Plant Health Australia, canegrowers were anticipating federal and state governments would pay 80 per cent of the $43 million emergency response plan.
But the National Management Group (NMG) voted against the proposal, suggesting the disease could not be eradicated or contained.
Isis Canegrowers chairman Joe Russo says the decision has shocked the cane growing community.
"It's no different from when you're told you first had smut, you're somewhat quite gutted to hear the response to what NMG have come down with," he said.

Polybag price increase hurts producers
The price of the woven polybags used to package seed, wool and fertiliser is set to rise due to soaring crude oil prices.
The bags are made from a petroleum-based resin, which has increased in price and is becoming harder to source from Asia.
Bob Adams, from Colquhouns Fremantle Bag company says producers can no longer absorb the cost, and are now looking at other options.
"We've seen costs rise by as much as 30 to 35 per cent over the last eight to nine months to the point it's slowly being passed onto the packers and the users of the bags," he said.

Financial lifeline saves Broken Hill YMCA
The Broken Hill YMCA will open within three months after being thrown a last minute lifeline.
The building was going on the market because it was $50,000 short of funds but it has been given that amount by its governing body.
A team of YMCA Australia staff will be in the city next week to meet with the board and develop a business plan and a long term management strategy.
New staff will be recruited and president Dionne Devlin says it still needs the ongoing support of the local community.
"We start straight away looking at the capital works that need to be done down there and organising the people that want to help and getting straight in and getting things done," she said.
