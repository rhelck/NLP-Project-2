# NLP-Project-2

## Overview

This is the README file for Project 2 of Dr. Michael Bloodgood's Natural Language Processing (CSC 427-01) class at The College of New Jersey, completed by Robert Helck, Michael Giordano, Geethika Manojkumar, and Poean Lu. This project asked our team to develop bigram and unigram language models implementing the Maximum Liklihood Estimation (MLE) method, as well as the Add-1 smoothing technique, as had been discussed in our class. Additionally, as part of this project our team was asked to performs a variety of experiments using our models and provide written analysis of the results thereof. Additional requirements for the project included (but were not limited to) analyzing the perplexity scores of our models, as well as finding and normalizing appropriate training and test data.

This README file will provide both an overview of the contents of this package, as well as detailed command line instructions on the proper installation and use of the program.
